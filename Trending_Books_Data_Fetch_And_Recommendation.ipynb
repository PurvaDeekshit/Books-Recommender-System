Which paint color is most likely to tell you that a used car is in good shape? How can officials identify the most dangerous New York City manholes before they explode? And how did Google searches predict the spread of the H1N1 flu outbreak? The key to answering these questions, and many more, is big data. “Big data” refers to our burgeoning ability to crunch vast collections of information, analyze it instantly, and draw sometimes profoundly surprising conclusions from it. This emerging science can translate myriad phenomena—from the price of airline tickets to the text of millions of books—into searchable form, and uses our increasing computing power to unearth epiphanies that we never could have seen before. A revolution on par with the Internet or perhaps even the printing press, big data will change the way we think about business, health, politics, education, and innovation in the years to come. It also poses fresh threats, from the inevitable end of privacy as we know it to the prospect of being penalized for things we haven’t even done yet, based on big data’s ability to predict our future behavior. In this brilliantly clear, often surprising work, two leading experts explain what big data is, how it will change our lives, and what we can do to protect ourselves from its hazards.

So in late 1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. But Kya is not what they say. Sensitive and intelligent, she has survived for years alone in the marsh that she calls home, finding friends in the gulls and lessons in the sand. Then the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. When two young men from town become intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new life--until the unthinkable happens. Perfect for fans of Barbara Kingsolver and Karen Russell, Where the Crawdads Sing is at once an exquisite ode to the natural world, a heartbreaking coming-of-age story, and a surprising tale of possible murder.

Named a Most Anticipated Book of 2019 by Oprah.com, Real Simple, Buzzfeed, Cosmopolitan, GoodReads, PureWow, Vulture, The Millions and more. \"Life is both fleeting and dangerous, and there is no point in denying yourself pleasure, or being anything other than what you are.\" Beloved author Elizabeth Gilbert returns to fiction with a unique love story set in the New York City theater world during the 1940s. Told from the perspective of an older woman as she looks back on her youth with both pleasure and regret (but mostly pleasure), City of Girls explores themes of female sexuality and promiscuity, as well as the idiosyncrasies of true love. In 1940, nineteen-year-old Vivian Morris has just been kicked out of Vassar College, owing to her lackluster freshman-year performance. Her affluent parents send her to Manhattan to live with her Aunt Peg, who owns a flamboyant, crumbling midtown theater called the Lily Playhouse. There Vivian is introduced to an entire cosmos of unconventional and charismatic characters, from the fun-chasing showgirls to a sexy male actor, a grand-dame actress, a lady-killer writer, and no-nonsense stage manager. But when Vivian makes a personal mistake that results in professional scandal, it turns her new world upside down in ways that it will take her years to fully understand. Ultimately, though, it leads her to a new understanding of the kind of life she craves - and the kind of freedom it takes to pursue it. It will also lead to the love of her life, a love that stands out from all the rest. Now eighty-nine years old and telling her story at last, Vivian recalls how the events of those years altered the course of her life - and the gusto and autonomy with which she approached it. \"At some point in a woman\\'s life, she just gets tired of being ashamed all the time,\" she muses. \"After that, she is free to become whoever she truly is.\" Written with a powerful wisdom about human desire and connection, City of Girls is a love story like no other.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780698408326'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0698408322'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 480, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Fiction'], 'averageRating': 3.5, 'ratingsCount': 6, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MOFwDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Hedge funds have typically been available only to the very affluent or to investors with inside contacts, but today that has changed. Almost any investor can now participate in a hedge fund and earn high returns. Why should you consider investing in a hedge fund? One reason is simply the high potential returns. Since January 1990, as measured by the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index, which accounts for more than 1,600 funds listed on the internal Hedge Fund Research (HFR) Database, hedge funds have returned 14 percent per year through October 2005. Many funds have earned triple digit returns. As with many other business segments, the Internet and technology have opened up this attractive marketplace to a new breed of individual investors and speculators working part-time. You and I are now on an even playing field with the largest banks, wealthiest individuals, and trading institutions from the comfort of our own homes. Hedge funds can provide you with very high, secure rate of return 12%, 18%, 24%, or even 300% per year. If performed correctly, hedge fund trading will far outpace all other investments. This all sounds great, but what is the catch? There really is none, except you must know what you are doing! The key is learning how to proceed. This groundbreaking and exhaustively researched new book will provide everything you need to know to get you started generating high-investment returns with low risk from start to finish. In this easy to read and comprehensive new book, you will find out how to invest in hedge funds, evaluate their performance, and employ investing strategies and tactics, deftly using the latest technology to set up your account online. You will be able to handle fees, taxes, and risks, and you will get little known data to help you double or even triple your investment all while avoiding the common traps and pitfalls. In addition, we took the extra effort and spent an unprecedented amount of time researching, interviewing, e-mailing, and communicating with hundreds of today s most successful hedge fund investors.

Now he returns with another epic - and groundbreaking - journey into our rapidly receding past. In The World Until Yesterday, Diamond reveals how traditional societies around the world offer an extraordinary window onto how our ancestors lived for the majority of human history - until virtually yesterday, in evolutionary terms - and provide unique, often overlooked insights into human nature. Drawing extensively on his decades working in the jungles of Papua New Guinea, Diamond explores how tribal societies approach essential human problems, from childrearing to conflict resolution to health, and discovers we have much to learn from traditional ways of life. He unearths remarkable findings - from the reason why modern afflictions like diabetes, obesity and Alzheimer's are virtually non-existent in tribal societies to the surprising benefits of multilingualism. Panoramic in scope and thrillingly original, The World Until Yesterday provides an enthralling first-hand picture of the human past that also suggests profound lessons for how to live well today. Jared Diamond is the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of the seminal million-copy-bestseller Guns, Germs, and Steel, which was named one of TIME's best non-fiction books of all time, and Collapse, a #1 international bestseller. A professor of geography at UCLA and noted polymath, Diamond's work has been influential in the fields of anthropology, biology, ornithology, ecology and history, among others.\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781846148156'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1846148154'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 512, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Social Science'], 'averageRating': 3.5, 'ratingsCount': 15, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=nech105NsugC&dq=current+trending+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

As the Civil Rights movement begins to reach the black enclave of Frenchtown in segregated Tallahassee, Elwood Curtis takes the words of Dr. Martin Luther King to heart: He is \"as good as anyone.\" Abandoned by his parents, but kept on the straight and narrow by his grandmother, Elwood is about to enroll in the local black college. But for a black boy in the Jim Crow South of the early 1960s, one innocent mistake is enough to destroy the future. Elwood is sentenced to a juvenile reformatory called the Nickel Academy, whose mission statement says it provides \"physical, intellectual and moral training\" so the delinquent boys in their charge can become \"honorable and honest men.\" In reality, the Nickel Academy is a grotesque chamber of horrors where the sadistic staff beats and sexually abuses the students, corrupt officials and locals steal food and supplies, and any boy who resists is likely to disappear \"out back.\" Stunned to find himself in such a vicious environment, Elwood tries to hold onto Dr. King\\'s ringing assertion \"Throw us in jail and we will still love you.\" His friend Turner thinks Elwood is worse than naive, that the world is crooked, and that the only way to survive is to scheme and avoid trouble. The tension between Elwood\\'s ideals and Turner\\'s skepticism leads to a decision whose repercussions will echo down the decades. Formed in the crucible of the evils Jim Crow wrought, the boys\\' fates will be determined by what they endured at the Nickel Academy. Based on the real story of a reform school in Florida that operated for one hundred and eleven years and warped the lives of thousands of children, The Nickel Boys is a devastating, driven narrative that showcases a great American novelist writing at the height of his powers.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780385537087'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0385537085'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 224, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Fiction'], 'averageRating': 4.5, 'ratingsCount': 9, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aDdyDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Not a big lie. He probably didn’t even consider it a lie, and neither did I, at first . . . In rural Virginia, Young and Pak Yoo run an experimental medical treatment device known as the Miracle Submarine—a pressurized oxygen chamber that patients enter for therapeutic “dives” with the hopes of curing issues like autism or infertility. But when the Miracle Submarine mysteriously explodes, killing two people, a dramatic murder trial upends the Yoos’ small community. Who or what caused the explosion? Was it the mother of one of the patients, who claimed to be sick that day but was smoking down by the creek? Or was it Young and Pak themselves, hoping to cash in on a big insurance payment and send their daughter to college? The ensuing trial uncovers unimaginable secrets from that night—trysts in the woods, mysterious notes, child-abuse charges—as well as tense rivalries and alliances among a group of people driven to extraordinary degrees of desperation and sacrifice.

It thrills us and torments us. It controls our thoughts, destroys our lives, and it’s all we live for. Yet we almost never speak of it. And as a buried force in our lives, desire remains largely unexplored—until now. Over the past eight years, journalist Lisa Taddeo has driven across the country six times to embed herself with ordinary women from different regions and backgrounds. The result, Three Women, is the deepest nonfiction portrait of desire ever written and one of the most anticipated books of the year. We begin in suburban Indiana with Lina, a homemaker and mother of two whose marriage, after a decade, has lost its passion. She passes her days cooking and cleaning for a man who refuses to kiss her on the mouth, protesting that “the sensation offends” him. To Lina’s horror, even her marriage counselor says her husband’s position is valid. Starved for affection, Lina battles daily panic attacks. When she reconnects with an old flame through social media, she embarks on an affair that quickly becomes all-consuming. In North Dakota we meet Maggie, a seventeen-year-old high school student who finds a confidant in her handsome, married English teacher. By Maggie’s account, supportive nightly texts and phone calls evolve into a clandestine physical relationship, with plans to skip school on her eighteenth birthday and make love all day; instead, he breaks up with her on the morning he turns thirty. A few years later, Maggie has no degree, no career, and no dreams to live for. When she learns that this man has been named North Dakota’s Teacher of the Year, she steps forward with her story—and is met with disbelief by former schoolmates and the jury that hears her case. The trial will turn their quiet community upside down. Finally, in an exclusive enclave of the Northeast, we meet Sloane—a gorgeous, successful, and refined restaurant owner—who is happily married to a man who likes to watch her have sex with other men and women. He picks out partners for her alone or for a threesome, and she ensures that everyone’s needs are satisfied. For years, Sloane has been asking herself where her husband’s desire ends and hers begins. One day, they invite a new man into their bed—but he brings a secret with him that will finally force Sloane to confront the uneven power dynamics that fuel their lifestyle. Based on years of immersive reporting, and told with astonishing frankness and immediacy, Three Women is a groundbreaking portrait of erotic longing in today’s America, exposing the fragility, complexity, and inequality of female desire with unprecedented depth and emotional power. It is both a feat of journalism and a triumph of storytelling, brimming with nuance and empathy, that introduces us to three unforgettable women—and one remarkable writer—whose experiences remind us that we are not alone.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781451642292'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1451642296'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 320, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['History'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=LNecDwAAQBAJ&dq=current+trending+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Since Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States, the country—and the world—has witnessed a stormy, outrageous, and absolutely mesmerizing presidential term that reflects the volatility and fierceness of the man elected Commander-in-Chief. This riveting and explosive account of Trump’s administration provides a wealth of new details about the chaos in the Oval Office, including: -- What President Trump’s staff really thinks of him -- What inspired Trump to claim he was wire-tapped by President Obama -- Why FBI director James Comey was really fired -- Why chief strategist Steve Bannon and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner couldn’t be in the same room -- Who is really directing the Trump administration’s strategy in the wake of Bannon’s firing -- What the secret to communicating with Trump is -- What the Trump administration has in common with the movie The Producers Never before in history has a presidency so divided the American people.

Pachuau surveys the current trending approaches to recognizing and investigating “world Christianity” and explores the salient features of the demographic changes that mark a measurable shift in the center of gravity from the northwest part of the globe to the southern continents. This shift is not just geographical. World Christianity is ultimately about the changing and diversifying character of Christianity and a renewed recognition of the dynamic universality of Christian faith itself: Christianity is a shared religion in that people of different cultures and societies make it their own while being transformed by it. Christanity is translatable and adaptable to all cultures while challenging each with its transformative power. Pachuau also charts the theological reestablishment of the missionary enterprise founded on understandings of God’s mission in the world (mission Dei), a mission of cross-cultural gospel diffusion for missionary advocates in the majority world but one of near neighbor missional engagement for the contagious Charismatic Christianity of the majority world. This book is both a descriptive study and a thoughtful analysis of world Christianity’s demographics, life, representation, and thought. The book an also gives an account of the historical emergence of World Christianity and its theological characteristics using a methodology that stresses the productive tension between the universal and particular in understanding a fundamentally adaptable Christian faith.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781501842306'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1501842307'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 172, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Religion'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gKIvDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Now you see her. Now you don’t. THE NEW GIRL. A new thriller of deception, betrayal, and vengeance. She was covered from head to toe in expensive wool and plaid, the sort of stuff one saw at the Burberry boutique in Harrods. She carried a leather bookbag rather than a nylon backpack. Her patent leather ballet slippers were glossy and bright. She was proper, the new girl, modest. But there was something else about her … At an exclusive private school in Switzerland, mystery surrounds the identity of the beautiful raven-haired girl who arrives each morning in a motorcade fit for a head of state. She is said to be the daughter of a wealthy international businessman. In truth, her father is Khalid bin Mohammed, the much-maligned crown prince of Saudi Arabia. Once celebrated for his daring social and religious reforms, he is now reviled for his role in the murder of a dissident journalist. And when his only child is brutally kidnapped, he turns to the one man he can trust to find her before it is too late. What’s done cannot be undone … Gabriel Allon, the legendary chief of Israeli intelligence, has spent most of his life fighting terrorists, including the murderous jihadists financed by Saudi Arabia. Prince Khalid—or KBM, as he is known—has pledged to finally break the bond between the Kingdom and radical Islam. For that reason alone, Gabriel regards him as a valuable if flawed partner. Together they will become unlikely allies in a deadly secret war for control of the Middle East. The life of a child, and the throne of Saudi Arabia, hang in the balance. Both men have made their share of enemies. And both have everything to lose. Filled with dark humor, breathtaking twists of plot, and an unforgettable cast of characters, The New Girl is both a thrilling, page-turning tale of entertainment and a sophisticated study of political alliances and great-power rivalries in a dangerous world. And it is once again proof that Gabriel Allon is “one of fiction’s greatest spies” (Kirkus) and Daniel Silva is “quite simply the best” (Kansas City Star) writer of foreign intrigue and suspense at work today.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780062834898'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0062834894'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 496, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Fiction'], 'averageRating': 5.0, 'ratingsCount': 1, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6GdzDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

A New York Times bestseller In 1986, a shy and intelligent twenty-year-old named Christopher Knight left his home in Massachusetts, drove to Maine, and disappeared into the forest.

This book also describes equations and math used in the development of the individual parts of the system. This book surveys current and previous publications for trending research in the ITS domain. It also covers state of the art standards that are in place for the DSRC in the US, starting from the application layer defined in SAE J2735 all the way to physical layer defined in IEEE 802.11. The authors provide a detailed discussion on what is needed to extend the current standards to accommodate future needs of the vehicle communications, such as needs for future autonomous vehicles. Programs and code examples accompany appropriate chapters, for example, after describing remote vehicle target classification function a pseudo code and description is provided. In addition, the book discusses current topics of the technology such as spectrum sharing, simulation, security, and privacy. The intended audience for this book includes engineering graduate students, automotive professionals/engineers, researchers and technology enthusiasts.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9783319947853'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '3319947850'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 271, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['BUSINESS & ECONOMICS'], 'averageRating': 5.0, 'ratingsCount': 1, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=rs10DwAAQBAJ&dq=current+trending+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Courtney Sullivan). COMING TO HULU IN 2020 • “Fresh and accessible . . . There is so much to say about Rooney’s fiction—in my experience, when people who’ve read her meet they tend to peel off into corners to talk.”—Dwight Garner, The New York Times At school Connell and Marianne pretend not to know each other. He’s popular and well-adjusted, star of the school football team, while she is lonely, proud, and intensely private. But when Connell comes to pick his mother up from her job at Marianne’s house, a strange and indelible connection grows between the two teenagers—one they are determined to conceal. A year later, they’re both studying at Trinity College in Dublin. Marianne has found her feet in a new social world while Connell hangs at the sidelines, shy and uncertain. Throughout their years at university, Marianne and Connell circle one another, straying toward other people and possibilities but always magnetically, irresistibly drawn back together. And as she veers into self-destruction and he begins to search for meaning elsewhere, each must confront how far they are willing to go to save the other. Sally Rooney brings her brilliant psychological acuity and perfectly spare prose to a story that explores the subtleties of class, the electricity of first love, and the complex entanglements of family and friendship. Praise for Normal People “I went into a tunnel with this book and didn’t want to come out. Absolutely engrossing and surprisingly heartbreaking with more depth, subtlety, and insight than any one novel deserves.”—Stephanie Danler, author of Sweetbitter “Arguably the buzziest novel of the season, Sally Rooney’s elegant sophomore effort . . . is a worthy successor to Conversations with Friends. Here, again, she unflinchingly explores class dynamics and young love with wit and nuance.”—The Wall Street Journal, “12 Best Books of Spring” “[Rooney] has been hailed as the first great millennial novelist for her stories of love and late capitalism. . . .

Deeply attuned to the cycles of democratic expansion and decay that determine the fates of nations, he watched with mounting unease as illiberal rulers rose in Hungary, Poland, Turkey, the Philippines, and beyond, while China and Russia grew increasingly bold and bullying. Then, with Trump\\'s election at home, the global retreat from freedom spread from democracy\\'s margins to its heart. Ill Winds\\' core argument is stark: the defense and advancement of democratic ideals relies on U.S. global leadership. If we do not reclaim our traditional place as the keystone of democracy, today\\'s authoritarian swell could become a tsunami, providing an opening for Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, and their admirers to turn the twenty-first century into a dark time of despotism. We are at a hinge in history, between a new era of tyranny and an age of democratic renewal. Free governments can defend their values; free citizens can exercise their rights. We can make the internet safe for liberal democracy, exploit the soft, kleptocratic underbelly of dictatorships, and revive America\\'s degraded democracy. Ill Winds offers concrete, deeply informed suggestions to fight polarization, reduce the influence of money in politics, and make every vote count. In 2019, freedom\\'s last line of defense still remains \"We the people.\"', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780525560630'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0525560637'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 368, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['History'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XOVvDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Much like human families, tree parents live together with their children, communicate with them, and support them as they grow, sharing nutrients with those who are sick or struggling and creating an ecosystem that mitigates the impact of extremes of heat and cold for the whole group. As a result of such interactions, trees in a family or community are protected and can live to be very old. In contrast, solitary trees, like street kids, have a tough time of it and in most cases die much earlier than those in a group. Drawing on groundbreaking new discoveries, Wohlleben presents the science behind the secret and previously unknown life of trees and their communication abilities; he describes how these discoveries have informed his own practices in the forest around him. As he says, a happy forest is a healthy forest, and he believes that eco-friendly practices not only are economically sustainable but also benefit the health of our planet and the mental and physical health of all who live on Earth.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9789386057877'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '9386057875'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 320, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Science'], 'averageRating': 4.0, 'ratingsCount': 1, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=KhnpDAAAQBAJ&dq=current+trending+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

In superbly crafted writing that burns with intensity, award-winning author Markus Zusak, author of I Am the Messenger, has given us one of the most enduring stories of our time. “The kind of book that can be life-changing.” —The New York Times “Deserves a place on the same shelf with The Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank.” —USA Today\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0307433846'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780307433848'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 592, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Young Adult Fiction'], 'averageRating': 4.5, 'ratingsCount': 2620, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=veGXULZK6UAC&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Most of plant diseases are visible and are caused by biotic and/or abiotic factors. Symptoms are usually the results of a morphological change, alteration or damage to plant tissue and/or cells due to an interference of the plant’s metabolism. All basic structures of vascular plants are subject to attack by pathogens. The failure in accurate disease diagnosis and management may lead to huge losses in plant production and related commodities, which causes nutritional food scarcity. Typically, the appearance of a biotic symptom will indicate the relatively late stage of an infection and/or colonization of a pathogen. Expert detection, accurate diagnosis, and timely management play a significant role in keeping plants free from pathogens. In this book expert scholars share their research knowledge and key literature which are vital toward the diagnosis of plant diseases across the globe, addressing traditional plant pathology techniques, as well as advanced molecular diagnostic approach.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9783319273129'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '3319273124'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 469, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Science'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lUUWDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

As part of the Treaty of Paris, in which Great Britain recognized the new United States of America, Britain ceded the land that comprised the immense Northwest Territory, a wilderness empire northwest of the Ohio River containing the future states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. A Massachusetts minister named Manasseh Cutler was instrumental in opening this vast territory to veterans of the Revolutionary War and their families for settlement. Included in the Northwest Ordinance were three remarkable conditions: freedom of religion, free universal education, and most importantly, the prohibition of slavery. In 1788 the first band of pioneers set out from New England for the Northwest Territory under the leadership of Revolutionary War veteran General Rufus Putnam. They settled in what is now Marietta on the banks of the Ohio River. McCullough tells the story through five major characters: Cutler and Putnam; Cutler’s son Ephraim; and two other men, one a carpenter turned architect, and the other a physician who became a prominent pioneer in American science. They and their families created a town in a primeval wilderness, while coping with such frontier realities as floods, fires, wolves and bears, no roads or bridges, no guarantees of any sort, all the while negotiating a contentious and sometimes hostile relationship with the native people. Like so many of McCullough’s subjects, they let no obstacle deter or defeat them. Drawn in great part from a rare and all-but-unknown collection of diaries and letters by the key figures, The Pioneers is a uniquely American story of people whose ambition and courage led them to remarkable accomplishments. This is a revelatory and quintessentially American story, written with David McCullough’s signature narrative energy.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781501168680'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1501168681'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 352, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['History'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=fI2RDwAAQBAJ&dq=current+trending+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

The Reckoning is Grisham\\'s argument that he\\'s not just a boilerplate thriller writer. Most jurors will think the counselor has made his case.\"--USA Today October 1946, Clanton, Mississippi Pete Banning was Clanton, Mississippi\\'s favorite son--a decorated World War II hero, the patriarch of a prominent family, a farmer, father, neighbor, and a faithful member of the Methodist church. Then one cool October morning he rose early, drove into town, and committed a shocking crime. Pete\\'s only statement about it--to the sheriff, to his lawyers, to the judge, to the jury, and to his family--was: \"I have nothing to say.\" He was not afraid of death and was willing to take his motive to the grave. In a major novel unlike anything he has written before, John Grisham takes us on an incredible journey, from the Jim Crow South to the jungles of the Philippines during World War II; from an insane asylum filled with secrets to the Clanton courtroom where Pete\\'s defense attorney tries desperately to save him. Reminiscent of the finest tradition of Southern Gothic storytelling, The Reckoning would not be complete without Grisham\\'s signature layers of legal suspense, and he delivers on every page.

In-depth guidance on assessing and managing pediatric health problems covers patients from infancy through adolescence. Four-part organization includes 1) an introductory unit on the foundations of global pediatric health, child and family health assessment, and cultural perspectives for pediatric primary care; 2) a unit on managing child development; 3) a unit on health promotion and management; and 4) a unit on disease management. Content devoted to issues of daily living covers issues that are a part of every child's growth - such as nutrition and toilet training - that could lead to health problems unless appropriate education and guidance are given. Algorithms are used throughout the book to provide a concise overview of the evaluation and management of common disorders. Resources for providers and families are also included throughout the text for further information.

The #1 New York Times bestseller and Time #1 Nonfiction Book of the Year: Hillary Rodham Clinton’s most personal memoir yet, about the 2016 presidential election. In this “candid and blackly funny” (The New York Times) memoir, Hillary Rodham Clinton reveals what she was thinking and feeling during one of the most controversial and unpredictable presidential elections in history. She takes us inside the intense personal experience of becoming the first woman nominated for president by a major party in an election marked by rage, sexism, exhilarating highs and infuriating lows, stranger-than-fiction twists, Russian interference, and an opponent who broke all the rules. “At her most emotionally raw” (People), Hillary describes what it was like to run against Donald Trump, the mistakes she made, how she has coped with a shocking and devastating loss, and how she found the strength to pick herself back up afterward. She tells readers what it took to get back on her feet—the rituals, relationships, and reading that got her through, and what the experience has taught her about life. In this “feminist manifesto” (The New York Times), she speaks to the challenges of being a strong woman in the public eye, the criticism over her voice, age, and appearance, and the double standard confronting women in politics. Offering a “bracing... guide to our political arena” (The Washington Post), What Happened lays out how the 2016 election was marked by an unprecedented assault on our democracy by a foreign adversary. By analyzing the evidence and connecting the dots, Hillary shows just how dangerous the forces are that shaped the outcome, and why Americans need to understand them to protect our values and our democracy in the future. The election of 2016 was unprecedented and historic. What Happened is the story of that campaign, now with a new epilogue showing how Hillary grappled with many of her worst fears coming true in the Trump Era, while finding new hope in a surge of civic activism, women running for office, and young people marching in the streets.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781501175572'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1501175572'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 512, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Biography & Autobiography'], 'averageRating': 4.0, 'ratingsCount': 24, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UjAIDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

For decades, we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. \"F**k positivity,\" Mark Manson says. \"Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it.\" In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up. Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—\"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault.\" Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek. There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience.

The Linear Regression Line is mainly used to determine trend direction. Linear regression can help you see trends in stock market prices. Instead of a price chart with scattered price points, the Linear Regression Line allows you to clearly see whether prices are trending upward, downward or sideways. When prices are below the Linear Regression Line, this could be viewed by some as a good time to buy, and when prices are above the Linear Regression Line, some might view it as a good time to sell. Unlike a Moving Average, the Linear Regression Indicator does not exhibit as much delay. It is more responsive to changes in prices. It shows where prices should be trading on a statistical basis and any excessive deviation from the regression line is likely to be short-lived. This ebook will show you how to calculate a linear regression line for a specified period. There are some examples on how to spot and calculate Buy Signals, Bullish Reversals, Divergences, Flags and Pennants, and many more.

President John F. Kennedy astonished the world on May 25, 1961, when he announced to Congress that the United States should land a man on the Moon by 1970. No group was more surprised than the scientists and engineers at NASA, who suddenly had less than a decade to invent space travel. When Kennedy announced that goal, no one knew how to navigate to the Moon. No one knew how to build a rocket big enough to reach the Moon, or how to build a computer small enough (and powerful enough) to fly a spaceship there. No one knew what the surface of the Moon was like, or what astronauts could eat as they flew there. On the day of Kennedy’s historic speech, America had a total of fifteen minutes of spaceflight experience—with just five of those minutes outside the atmosphere. Russian dogs had more time in space than U.S. astronauts. Over the next decade, more than 400,000 scientists, engineers, and factory workers would send 24 astronauts to the Moon. Each hour of space flight would require one million hours of work back on Earth to get America to the Moon on July 20, 1969. Fifty years later, One Giant Leap is the sweeping, definitive behind-the-scenes account of the furious race to complete one of mankind’s greatest achievements. It’s a story filled with surprises—from the item the astronauts almost forgot to take with them (the American flag), to the extraordinary impact Apollo would have back on Earth, and on the way we live today. Charles Fishman introduces readers to the men and women who had to solve 10,000 problems before astronauts could reach the Moon. From the research labs of MIT, where the eccentric and legendary pioneer Charles Draper created the tools to fly the Apollo spaceships, to the factories where dozens of women sewed spacesuits, parachutes, and even computer hardware by hand, Fishman captures the exceptional feats of these ordinary Americans. One Giant Leap is the captivating story of men and women charged with changing the world as we knew it—their leaders, their triumphs, their near disasters, all of which led to arguably the greatest success story, and the greatest adventure story, of the twentieth century.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781501106293'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1501106295'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 480, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['History'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=UtecDwAAQBAJ&dq=current+trending+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

When is it Right to Die? offers a different path with alternatives of hope, compassion, and death with real dignity. Joni Eareckson Tada knows what it means to wrestle with this issue and to wish for a painless solution. For the last 50 years she has been confined to a wheelchair and struggled against her own paralysis. And she sat by the bedside of her dying father, thinking, So much suffering, why not end it all quickly, painlessly? The terminally ill, the elderly, the disabled, the depressed and suicidal, can all be swept up into this movement of self-deliverance. Skip the suffering. Put a quick end to merciless pain and mental anguish. These are tempting enticements to the hurting. Joni doesn’t give pat answers. Instead, she gives warm comfort from God and practical help to meet the realities for those facing death. When Is It Right to Die tells the stories of families who have wrestled with end-of-life questions and found that death with dignity does not necessarily mean three grams of Phenobarbital in the veins. Behind every right-to-die situation is a family. A family like yours. In her warm, personal way, Joni takes the reader into the lives of families and lets them speak about assisted suicide. What they say is surprising. Whether you have a dying family member, facing moral and medical choices, or struggling with a chronic condition that feels overwhelming, this book will help you find practical encouragement and biblical advice to help you make difficult decisions. This book is revised and updated to examine the current events, trending issues, and the rising acceptance of assisted suicide in this country.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780310349952'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0310349958'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 208, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Religion'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HHlDDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

What truly influences our decisions in today’s message-cluttered world? An eye-grabbing advertisement, a catchy slogan, an infectious jingle? Or do our buying decisions take place below the surface, so deep within our subconscious minds, we’re barely aware of them? In BUYOLOGY, Lindstrom presents the astonishing findings from his groundbreaking, three-year, seven-million-dollar neuromarketing study, a cutting-edge experiment that peered inside the brains of 2,000 volunteers from all around the world as they encountered various ads, logos, commercials, brands, and products. His startling results shatter much of what we have long believed about what seduces our interest and drives us to buy. Among the questions he explores: Does sex actually sell? To what extent do people in skimpy clothing and suggestive poses persuade us to buy products? Despite government bans, does subliminal advertising still surround us – from bars to highway billboards to supermarket shelves? Can “Cool” brands, like iPods, trigger our mating instincts? Can other senses – smell, touch, and sound - be so powerful as to physically arouse us when we see a product? Do companies copy from the world of religion and create rituals – like drinking a Corona with a lime – to capture our hard-earned dollars? Filled with entertaining inside stories about how we respond to such well-known brands as Marlboro, Nokia, Calvin Klein, Ford, and American Idol, BUYOLOGY is a fascinating and shocking journey into the mind of today’s consumer that will captivate anyone who’s been seduced – or turned off – by marketers’ relentless attempts to win our loyalty, our money, and our minds.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0385528299'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780385528290'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 256, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Business & Economics'], 'averageRating': 3.0, 'ratingsCount': 19, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=67T4RjlBLhoC&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Justice Anthony Kennedy slipped out of the Supreme Court building on June 27, 2018, and traveled incognito to the White House to inform President Donald Trump that he was retiring, setting in motion a political process that his successor, Brett Kavanaugh, would denounce three months later as a “national disgrace” and a “circus.” Justice on Trial, the definitive insider’s account of Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Supreme Court, is based on extraordinary access to more than one hundred key figures—including the president, justices, and senators—in that ferocious political drama. The Trump presidency opened with the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to succeed the late Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. But the following year, when Trump drew from the same list of candidates for his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, the justice being replaced was the swing vote on abortion, and all hell broke loose. The judicial confirmation process, on the point of breakdown for thirty years, now proved utterly dysfunctional. Unverified accusations of sexual assault became weapons in a ruthless campaign of personal destruction, culminating in the melodramatic hearings in which Kavanaugh’s impassioned defense resuscitated a nomination that seemed beyond saving. The Supreme Court has become the arbiter of our nation’s most vexing and divisive disputes. With the stakes of each vacancy incalculably high, the incentive to destroy a nominee is nearly irresistible. The next time a nomination promises to change the balance of the Court, Hemingway and Severino warn, the confirmation fight will be even uglier than Kavanaugh’s. A good person might accept that nomination in the naïve belief that what happened to Kavanaugh won’t happen to him because he is a good person. But it can happen, it does happen, and it just happened. The question is whether America will let it happen again.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781621579847'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1621579840'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 375, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Political Science'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HpGMDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Students pack up and head back to their dorms. The professor, meanwhile, goes to her car . . . to catch a little sleep, and then eat a cheeseburger in her lap before driving across the city to a different university to teach another, wholly different class. All for a paycheck that, once prep and grading are factored in, barely reaches minimum wage. Welcome to the life of the mind in the gig economy. Over the past few decades, the job of college professor has been utterly transformed—for the worse. America’s colleges and universities were designed to serve students and create knowledge through the teaching, research, and stability that come with the longevity of tenured faculty, but higher education today is dominated by adjuncts. In 1975, only thirty percent of faculty held temporary or part-time positions. By 2011, as universities faced both a decrease in public support and ballooning administrative costs, that number topped fifty percent. Now, some surveys suggest that as many as seventy percent of American professors are working course-to-course, with few benefits, little to no security, and extremely low pay. In The Adjunct Underclass, Herb Childress draws on his own firsthand experience and that of other adjuncts to tell the story of how higher education reached this sorry state. Pinpointing numerous forces within and beyond higher ed that have driven this shift, he shows us the damage wrought by contingency, not only on the adjunct faculty themselves, but also on students, the permanent faculty and administration, and the nation. How can we say that we value higher education when we treat educators like desperate day laborers? Measured but passionate, rooted in facts but sure to shock, The Adjunct Underclass reveals the conflicting values, strangled resources, and competing goals that have fundamentally changed our idea of what college should be.

The mind can take you anywhere you want to go Eli Bell’s life is complicated. His father is lost, his mother is in jail, and his stepdad is a heroin dealer. The most steadfast adult in Eli’s life is Slim—a notorious felon and national record-holder for successful prison escapes—who watches over Eli and August, his silent genius of an older brother. Exiled far from the rest of the world in Darra, a seedy suburb populated by Polish and Vietnamese refugees, this twelve-year-old boy with an old soul and an adult mind is just trying to follow his heart, learn what it takes to be a good man, and train for a glamorous career in journalism. Life, however, insists on throwing obstacles in Eli’s path—most notably Tytus Broz, Brisbane’s legendary drug dealer. But the real trouble lies ahead. Eli is about to fall in love, face off against truly bad guys, and fight to save his mother from a certain doom—all before starting high school. A story of brotherhood, true love, family, and the most unlikely of friendships, Boy Swallows Universe is the tale of an adolescent boy on the cusp of discovering the man he will be.

I fell in love with Eleanor, an eccentric and regimented loner whose life beautifully unfolds after a chance encounter with a stranger; I think you will fall in love, too!” —Reese Witherspoon No one’s ever told Eleanor that life should be better than fine. Meet Eleanor Oliphant: She struggles with appropriate social skills and tends to say exactly what she’s thinking. Nothing is missing in her carefully timetabled life of avoiding social interactions, where weekends are punctuated by frozen pizza, vodka, and phone chats with Mummy. But everything changes when Eleanor meets Raymond, the bumbling and deeply unhygienic IT guy from her office. When she and Raymond together save Sammy, an elderly gentleman who has fallen on the sidewalk, the three become the kinds of friends who rescue one another from the lives of isolation they have each been living. And it is Raymond’s big heart that will ultimately help Eleanor find the way to repair her own profoundly damaged one. Soon to be a major motion picture produced by Reese Witherspoon, Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine is the smart, warm, and uplifting story of an out-of-the-ordinary heroine whose deadpan weirdness and unconscious wit make for an irresistible journey as she realizes. . .

In an era of education budget cuts, wealthy donors intervening in university decisions, and right-wing groups threatening dissenters, scholars cannot expect that those in power will value their work. Can academic freedom survive in this environment—and must we rearticulate what academic freedom is in order to defend it? This book presents a series of essays by the renowned historian Joan Wallach Scott that explore the history and theory of free inquiry and its value today. Scott considers the contradictions in the concept of academic freedom. She examines the relationship between state power and higher education; the differences between the First Amendment right of free speech and the guarantee of academic freedom; and, in response to recent campus controversies, the politics of civility. The book concludes with an interview conducted by Bill Moyers in which Scott discusses the personal experiences that have informed her views. Academic freedom is an aspiration, Scott holds: its implementation always falls short of its promise, but it is essential as an ideal of ethical practice. Knowledge, Power, and Academic Freedom is both a nuanced reflection on the tensions within a cherished concept and a strong defense of the importance of critical scholarship to safeguard democracy against the anti-intellectualism of figures from Joseph McCarthy to Donald Trump.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780231548939'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0231548931'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': None, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Education'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pWNbDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

A New Reality: Human Evolution for a Sustainable Future provides a startling, fresh new message of understanding, perspective and hope for today’s tense, rapid-fire, kaleidoscopically changing world. Drawn from the writings of visionary scientist Jonas Salk, who developed the polio vaccine, extended and developed by his son Jonathan, the message of the book explodes from the past and sheds light on tensions that besiege us and the currents of discord that are raging as these words are written. More importantly, it indicates a way forward out of our current situation. Written by a world-famous doctor and folk hero, based on population data, rich in visual imagery, elegantly designed, and clearly written, A New Reality is unique in the marketplace. Readable in one or two sittings, it is accessible to the general reader while at the same time being of essential value to policy makers and academics. Its brevity and simplicity of design belie the importance and sophistication of its message. “We are at a point in the course of human social evolution when the demands of survival converge with the higher ideals of humankind and the well-being and flourishing of human society. It is up to us to see that we navigate this transition, adapting to and emerging in a new reality.” —A New Reality Our country is divided and polarized. Terrorism is a major threat throughout much of the world. Mass migrations are causing national and international tension. Population growth continues to increase, especially in the developing regions of the world. Controversy rages as to the use of fossil fuels versus the development of alternative forms of energy. Disagreement continues about climate change. Opposing currents of opinion collide as to how much we should help other areas in the world and how much to help ourselves. Basic values are in conflict. More than 40 years ago, Jonas Salk understood that we are at a unique moment in the history of the human species. After centuries of increase, population growth has begun to slow and is trending toward equilibrium. This change is accompanied by an equally significant change in human values—a shift from those based on unlimited availability of resources, unremitting growth, excess, independence, competition and short-term thinking to those based on limits, equilibrium, balance, interdependence, cooperation and long-term thinking. This momentous transition is the source of far-reaching tension and conflict. The way through this difficult era is to understand its basis and to focus on new values that will be of the greatest benefit to humankind. There is an urgency, however, and failure to adapt will result in disaster both for humanity and for the planet as a whole. A New Reality delivers a message of both caution and hope. Readers across the social and political spectrum will find it a reasoned and balanced counterpoint to current social and political trends. Its elegant design and long-range perspective will appeal to general readers, policy makers, millennials, baby boomers, teachers, and students, filling a need in the marketplace for a work of positivity and wisdom in otherwise bleak times.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781947951051'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '194795105X'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 240, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Political Science'], 'averageRating': 5.0, 'ratingsCount': 1, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XmJEDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Comedy legends and A-list actors. Supermodels and centerfolds. Moguls and mobsters. A president. Over his unrivaled four-decade career in radio, Howard Stern has interviewed thousands of personalities—discussing sex, relationships, money, fame, spirituality, and success with the boldest of bold-faced names. But which interviews are his favorites? It’s one of the questions he gets asked most frequently. Howard Stern Comes Again delivers his answer. This book is a feast of conversation and more, as between the lines Stern offers his definitive autobiography—a magnum opus of confession and personal exploration. Tracy Morgan opens up about his near-fatal car crash. Lady Gaga divulges her history with cocaine. Madonna reminisces on her relationship with Tupac Shakur. Bill Murray waxes philosophical on the purpose of life. Jerry Seinfeld offers a master class on comedy. Harvey Weinstein denies the existence of the so-called casting couch. An impressive array of creative visionaries weigh in on what Stern calls “the climb”—the stories of how they struggled and eventually prevailed. As he writes in the introduction, “If you’re having trouble finding motivation in life and you’re looking for that extra kick in the ass, you will find it in these pages.” Interspersed throughout are rare selections from the Howard Stern Show archives with Donald Trump that depict his own climb: transforming from Manhattan tabloid fixture to reality TV star to president of the United States. Stern also tells of his Moby Dick-like quest to land an interview with Hillary Clinton in the run-up to the 2016 election—one of many newly written revelations from the author. He speaks with extraordinary candor about a variety of subjects, including his overwhelming insecurity early in his career, his revolutionary move from terrestrial radio to SiriusXM, and his belief in the power of psychotherapy. As Stern insightfully notes in the introduction: “The interviews collected here represent my best work and show my personal evolution. But they don’t just show my evolution. Gathered together like this, they show the evolution of popular culture over the past quarter century.”', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781501194313'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1501194313'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 560, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Biography & Autobiography'], 'averageRating': 3.0, 'ratingsCount': 1, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CqVkDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

If your anxiety about global warming is dominated by fears of sea-level rise, you are barely scratching the surface of what terrors are possible. In California, wildfires now rage year-round, destroying thousands of homes. Across the US, “500-year” storms pummel communities month after month, and floods displace tens of millions annually. This is only a preview of the changes to come. And they are coming fast. Without a revolution in how billions of humans conduct their lives, parts of the Earth could become close to uninhabitable, and other parts horrifically inhospitable, as soon as the end of this century. In his travelogue of our near future, David Wallace-Wells brings into stark relief the climate troubles that await—food shortages, refugee emergencies, and other crises that will reshape the globe. But the world will be remade by warming in more profound ways as well, transforming our politics, our culture, our relationship to technology, and our sense of history. It will be all-encompassing, shaping and distorting nearly every aspect of human life as it is lived today. Like An Inconvenient Truth and Silent Spring before it, The Uninhabitable Earth is both a meditation on the devastation we have brought upon ourselves and an impassioned call to action. For just as the world was brought to the brink of catastrophe within the span of a lifetime, the responsibility to avoid it now belongs to a single generation. Praise for The Uninhabitable Earth “The Uninhabitable Earth is the most terrifying book I have ever read. Its subject is climate change, and its method is scientific, but its mode is Old Testament.

It’s “the year’s most galvanizing debut novel” (Entertainment Weekly). As we learn the reasons that each person is attending the Big Oakland Powwow—some generous, some fearful, some joyful, some violent—momentum builds toward a shocking yet inevitable conclusion that changes everything. Jacquie Red Feather is newly sober and trying to make it back to the family she left behind in shame. Dene Oxendene is pulling his life back together after his uncle’s death and has come to work at the powwow to honor his uncle’s memory. Opal Viola Victoria Bear Shield has come to watch her nephew Orvil, who has taught himself traditional Indian dance through YouTube videos and will to perform in public for the very first time.

Trump. The 2016 election was a watershed for the United States. But, as Tim Alberta explains in American Carnage, to understand Trump’s victory is to view him not as the creator of this era of polarization and bruising partisanship, but rather as its most manifest consequence. American Carnage is the story of a president’s rise based on a country’s evolution and a party’s collapse. As George W. Bush left office with record-low approval ratings and Barack Obama led a Democratic takeover of Washington, Republicans faced a moment of reckoning: They had no vision, no generation of new leaders, and no energy in the party’s base. Yet Obama’s forceful pursuit of his progressive agenda, coupled with the nation’s rapidly changing cultural and demographic landscape, lit a fire under the right, returning Republicans to power and inviting a bloody struggle for the party’s identity in the post-Bush era. The factions that emerged—one led by absolutists like Jim Jordan and Ted Cruz, the other led by pragmatists like John Boehner and Mitch McConnell—engaged in a series of devastating internecine clashes and attempted coups for control. With the GOP’s internal fissures rendering it legislatively impotent, and that impotence fueling a growing resentment toward the political class and its institutions, the stage was set for an outsider to crash the party. When Trump descended a gilded escalator to announce his run in the summer of 2015, the candidate had met the moment. Only by viewing Trump as the culmination of a decade-long civil war inside the Republican Party—and of the parallel sense of cultural, socioeconomic, and technological disruption during that period—can we appreciate how he won the White House and consider the fundamental questions at the center of America’s current turmoil. How did a party obsessed with the national debt vote for trillion-dollar deficits and record-setting spending increases? How did the party of compassionate conservatism become the party of Muslim bans and walls? How did the party of family values elect a thrice-divorced philanderer? And, most important, how long can such a party survive? Loaded with exclusive reporting and based off hundreds of interviews—including with key players such as President Trump, Paul Ryan, Ted Cruz, John Boehner, Mitch McConnell, Jim DeMint, and Reince Priebus, and many others—American Carnage takes us behind the scenes of this tumultuous period as we’ve never seen it before and establishes Tim Alberta as the premier chronicler of this political era.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780062896360'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0062896369'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 688, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Political Science'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vwSdDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

These movements emerge out of distinct contexts and yield different outcomes, but tend to share one thing in common: online and offline solidarity shaped around the public display of emotion. Social media facilitate feelings of engagement, in ways that frequently make people feel re-energized about politics. In doing so, media do not make or break revolutions but they do lend emerging, storytelling publics their own means for feeling their way into events, frequently by making those involved a part of the developing story. Technologies network us but it is our stories that connect us to each other, making us feel close to some and distancing us from others. Affective Publics explores how storytelling practices facilitate engagement among movements tuning into a current issue or event by employing three case studies: Arab Spring movements, various iterations of Occupy, and everyday casual political expressions as traced through the archives of trending topics on Twitter. It traces how affective publics materialize and disband around connective conduits of sentiment every day and find their voice through the soft structures of feeling sustained by societies. Using original quantitative and qualitative data, Affective Publics demonstrates, in this groundbreaking analysis, that it is through these soft structures that affective publics connect, disrupt, and feel their way into everyday politics.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780199999736'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0199999732'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 160, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Political Science'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=ffMVDAAAQBAJ&dq=current+trending+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

A brilliant and brave investigation into the medical and scientific revolution taking place around psychedelic drugs--and the spellbinding story of his own life-changing psychedelic experiences When Michael Pollan set out to research how LSD and psilocybin (the active ingredient in magic mushrooms) are being used to provide relief to people suffering from difficult-to-treat conditions such as depression, addiction and anxiety, he did not intend to write what is undoubtedly his most personal book. But upon discovering how these remarkable substances are improving the lives not only of the mentally ill but also of healthy people coming to grips with the challenges of everyday life, he decided to explore the landscape of the mind in the first person as well as the third. Thus began a singular adventure into various altered states of consciousness, along with a dive deep into both the latest brain science and the thriving underground community of psychedelic therapists. Pollan sifts the historical record to separate the truth about these mysterious drugs from the myths that have surrounded them since the 1960s, when a handful of psychedelic evangelists inadvertently catalyzed a powerful backlash against what was then a promising field of research. A unique and elegant blend of science, memoir, travel writing, history, and medicine, How to Change Your Mind is a triumph of participatory journalism. By turns dazzling and edifying, it is the gripping account of a journey to an exciting and unexpected new frontier in our understanding of the mind, the self, and our place in the world. The true subject of Pollan\\'s \"mental travelogue\" is not just psychedelic drugs but also the eternal puzzle of human consciousness and how, in a world that offers us both suffering and joy, we can do our best to be fully present and find meaning in our lives.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780525558941'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0525558942'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 480, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Body, Mind & Spirit'], 'averageRating': 4.0, 'ratingsCount': 11, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3vk5DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

As a college student, Abigail Favale experienced a feminist awakening that reshaped her life and faith. A decade later, on the verge of atheism, she found herself entering the oldest male-helmed institution on the planet--the last place she expected to be. With humor and insight, the author describes her gradual exodus from Christian orthodoxy and surprising swerve into Catholicism. She writes candidly about grappling with wounds from her past, Catholic sexual morality, the male priesthood, and an interfaith marriage. Her vivid prose brings to life the wrenching tumult of conversion--a conversion that began after she entered the Church and began to pry open its mysteries. There, she discovered the startling beauty of a sacramental cosmos, a vision of reality that upended her notions of gender, sexuality, identity, and authority.

In 1927, Zora Neale Hurston went to Plateau, Alabama, just outside Mobile, to interview eighty-six-year-old Cudjo Lewis. Of the millions of men, women, and children transported from Africa to America as slaves, Cudjo was then the only person alive to tell the story of this integral part of the nation’s history. Hurston was there to record Cudjo’s firsthand account of the raid that led to his capture and bondage fifty years after the Atlantic slave trade was outlawed in the United States. In 1931, Hurston returned to Plateau, the African-centric community three miles from Mobile founded by Cudjo and other former slaves from his ship. Spending more than three months there, she talked in depth with Cudjo about the details of his life. During those weeks, the young writer and the elderly formerly enslaved man ate peaches and watermelon that grew in the backyard and talked about Cudjo’s past—memories from his childhood in Africa, the horrors of being captured and held in a barracoon for selection by American slavers, the harrowing experience of the Middle Passage packed with more than 100 other souls aboard the Clotilda, and the years he spent in slavery until the end of the Civil War. Based on those interviews, featuring Cudjo’s unique vernacular, and written from Hurston’s perspective with the compassion and singular style that have made her one of the preeminent American authors of the twentieth-century, Barracoon masterfully illustrates the tragedy of slavery and of one life forever defined by it. Offering insight into the pernicious legacy that continues to haunt us all, black and white, this poignant and powerful work is an invaluable contribution to our shared history and culture.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780062748225'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '006274822X'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 208, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Social Science'], 'averageRating': 4.0, 'ratingsCount': 15, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UccvDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Here begins the epic story of a small African nation, told by a mysterious swarm-like chorus that calls itself man’s greatest nemesis. The tale? A playful panorama of history, fairytale, romance and science fiction. The moral? To err is human. In 1904, in a smoky room at the hotel across the river, an Old Drifter named Percy M.

Fred Kofman\\'s approach to leadership has little to do with the standard practices taught in business school and traditional books. Bringing together economics and business theory, communications and conflict resolution, family counseling and mindfulness mediation, Kofman argues in The Meaning Revolution that our most deep-seated, unspoken, and universal anxiety stems from our fear that our life is being wasted--that the end of life will overtake us when our song is still unsung. Material incentives--salary and benefits--account for perhaps 15 percent of employees\\' motivation at work.

As directed by Graham McLaren, Bloom’s odyssey is a pandemonium of live music, puppets and clowning; a production that, in the words of The Arts Review, “throws its arms wide open and bids everyone welcome”.

From the moment she entered the world, Francie needed to be made of stern stuff, for the often harsh life of Williamsburg demanded fortitude, precocity, and strength of spirit. Often scorned by neighbors for her family’s erratic and eccentric behavior—such as her father Johnny’s taste for alcohol and Aunt Sissy’s habit of marrying serially without the formality of divorce—no one, least of all Francie, could say that the Nolans’ life lacked drama. By turns overwhelming, sublime, heartbreaking, and uplifting, the Nolans’ daily experiences are tenderly threaded with family connectedness and raw with honesty. Betty Smith has, in the pages of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, captured the joys of humble Williamsburg life-from “junk day” on Saturdays, when the children of Francie’s neighborhood traded their weekly take for pennies, to the special excitement of holidays, bringing cause for celebration and revelry.

Now, for the first time in English, this book presents the next stage of candlestick analysis - Ichimoku Kinko Hyo. Sometimes called Cloud Charts, this analysis adds moving averages to candlestick charts. But moving averages a little different from those traditionally used in the West. For trending markets, Cloud Charts add an essential tool for analysing near-term areas of support and resistance. The book covers the history of candlestick charts - explaining the context in which they developed. And then moves on to explain how in the 1930s a journalist, with the pseudonym Ichimoku Sanjin, started refining candlestick analysis by adding a series of moving averages. The book explains in detail how to construct Cloud Charts and how to interpret them. A chapter is devoted to the advanced analysis of Cloud charts, with an in-depth study of the Three Principles: Wave Principle, Price Target and Timespan Principle. The book is illustrated throughout with numerous examples of Cloud Chart analysis.

Mrs. Everything is an ambitious, richly textured journey through history—and herstory—as these two sisters navigate a changing America over the course of their lives. Do we change or does the world change us? Jo and Bethie Kaufman were born into a world full of promise. Growing up in 1950s Detroit, they live in a perfect “Dick and Jane” house, where their roles in the family are clearly defined. Jo is the tomboy, the bookish rebel with a passion to make the world more fair; Bethie is the pretty, feminine good girl, a would-be star who enjoys the power her beauty confers and dreams of a traditional life. But the truth ends up looking different from what the girls imagined. Jo and Bethie survive traumas and tragedies. As their lives unfold against the background of free love and Vietnam, Woodstock and women’s lib, Bethie becomes an adventure-loving wild child who dives headlong into the counterculture and is up for anything (except settling down). Meanwhile, Jo becomes a proper young mother in Connecticut, a witness to the changing world instead of a participant. Neither woman inhabits the world she dreams of, nor has a life that feels authentic or brings her joy. Is it too late for the women to finally stake a claim on happily ever after? In her most ambitious novel yet, Jennifer Weiner tells a story of two sisters who, with their different dreams and different paths, offer answers to the question: How should a woman be in the world?', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781982131777'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1982131772'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 480, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Fiction'], 'averageRating': 3.5, 'ratingsCount': 9, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=WViYDwAAQBAJ&dq=current+trending+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

The ensuing climate cataclysm will soon render the earth inhospitable for humanity, as the last such meteorite did for the dinosaurs. This looming threat calls for a radically accelerated effort to colonize space, and requires a much larger share of humanity to take part in the process.

But with so many skilled and experienced women pilots and scientists involved with the program, it doesn’t take long before Elma begins to wonder why they can’t go into space, too.

Zack Lightman has never much cared for reality. He vastly prefers the countless science-fiction movies, books, and videogames he's spent his life consuming. And too often, he catches himself wishing that some fantastic, impossible, world-altering event could arrive to whisk him off on a grand spacefaring adventure. So when he sees the flying saucer, he's sure his years of escapism have finally tipped over into madness. Especially because the alien ship he's staring at is straight out of his favorite videogame, a flight simulator callled Armada--in which gamers just happen to be protecting Earth from alien invaders. As impossible as it seems, what Zack's seeing is all too real. And it's just the first in a blur of revlations that will force him to question everything he thought he knew about Earth's history, its future, even his own life--and to play the hero for real, with humanity's life in the balance. But even through the terror and exhilaration, he can't help thinking: Doesn't something about this scenario feel a little bit like...well...fiction?

He's been given a chance for a new start with the Oslo Police but it's in the cold case office, when what he really wants is to be investigating cases he suspects have ties to Svein Finne, the serial rapist and murderer who Harry helped put behind bars. And now, Finne is free after a decade-plus in prison--free, and Harry is certain, unreformed and ready to take up where he left off. But things will get worse.

Norton & Company', 'publishedDate': '2019-06-04', 'description': 'From the best-selling, award-winning author of Landmarks and The Old Ways, a haunting voyage into the planet’s past and future. Hailed as \"the great nature writer of this generation\" (Wall Street Journal), Robert Macfarlane is the celebrated author of books about the intersections of the human and the natural realms. In Underland, he delivers his masterpiece: an epic exploration of the Earth’s underworlds as they exist in myth, literature, memory, and the land itself. In this highly anticipated sequel to his international bestseller The Old Ways, Macfarlane takes us on an extraordinary journey into our relationship with darkness, burial, and what lies beneath the surface of both place and mind. Traveling through “deep time”—the dizzying expanses of geologic time that stretch away from the present—he moves from the birth of the universe to a post-human future, from the prehistoric art of Norwegian sea caves to the blue depths of the Greenland ice cap, from Bronze Age funeral chambers to the catacomb labyrinth below Paris, and from the underground fungal networks through which trees communicate to a deep-sunk “hiding place” where nuclear waste will be stored for 100,000 years to come. “Woven through Macfarlane’s own travels are the unforgettable stories of descents into the underland made across history by explorers, artists, cavers, divers, mourners, dreamers, and murderers, all of whom have been drawn for different reasons to seek what Cormac McCarthy calls “the awful darkness within the world.” Global in its geography and written with great lyricism and power, Underland speaks powerfully to our present moment. Taking a deep-time view of our planet, Macfarlane here asks a vital and unsettling question: “Are we being good ancestors to the future Earth?” Underland marks a new turn in Macfarlane’s long-term mapping of the relations of landscape and the human heart. From its remarkable opening pages to its deeply moving conclusion, it is a journey into wonder, loss, fear, and hope. At once ancient and urgent, this is a book that will change the way you see the world.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780393242157'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0393242153'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 384, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Nature'], 'averageRating': 4.0, 'ratingsCount': 2, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SwJ1DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

In fact, it is much more than a trend. It relates to an ancient, permanent issue which directly connects with people’s life and basic needs: the recognition and protection of individuals’ dignity, in particular the inherent worthiness of the most vulnerable human beings. The content of this book is described well enough by its title: ‘Human Dignity of the Vulnerable in the Age of Rights’. Certainly, we do not claim that only the human dignity of vulnerable people should be recognized and protected. We rather argue that, since vulnerability is part of the human condition, human vulnerability is not at odds with human dignity. To put it simply, human dignity is compatible with vulnerability. A concept of human dignity which discards or denies the dignity of the vulnerable and weak is at odds with the real human condition. Even those individuals who might seem more skilled and talented are fragile, vulnerable and limited. We need to realize that human condition is not limitless. It is crucial to re-discover a sense of moderation regarding ourselves, a sense of reality concerning our own nature. Some lines of thought take the opposite view. It is sometimes argued that humankind is – or is called to be – powerful, and that the time will come when there will be no vulnerability, no fragility, no limits at all. Human beings will become like God (or what believers might think God to be). This perspective rejects human vulnerability as in intrinsic evil. Those who are frail or weak, who are not autonomous or not able to care for themselves, do not possess dignity. In this volume it is claimed that vulnerability is an inherent part of human condition, and because human dignity belongs to all individuals, laws are called to recognize and protect the rights of all of them, particularly of those who might appear to be more vulnerable and fragile.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9783319326931'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '3319326937'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 338, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Law'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PyPqDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

There is actually a growing body of evidence that indicates that looking outside of your company (rather than purely looking internally) and to customers’ needs, using the tools in this Handbook, will lead to more innovative ideas. Responding to customers’ needs is the key to a successful business. You can use these tools to talk to customers—satisfied ones, unsatisfied ones, potential customers, people who would never buy your product or service, and also people you have never considered as a potential customer. In addition, these tools will help you ask your competitors’ customers about what makes them happy with the current businesses and offerings in the industry, why they buy or do not buy from you, your competitors, and other industries. These tools will help you understand the steps in the customer journey they need to take, what delights and frustrates them, and what their pain points are. The three volumes of The Innovation Tools Handbook cover 76 top-rated tools and methods, from the hundreds available, that every innovator must master to be successful. Covering evolutionary and/or improvement innovative tools and methodologies, Volume 2 presents 23 tools/methodologies related to innovative evolutionary products, processes, and services, or the improvement of existing ones. For each tool, the book provides a definition, identifies the user of the tool, explains what phases of the innovation process the tool is used, describes how the tool is used, supplies examples of the outputs from the tool, identifies software that can maximize its effectiveness, and includes references and suggestions for further reading. Ideation is about developing ideas on how to seize identified opportunities. What are the possible answers to your breakthrough questions? Having a deep understanding about the customer, their needs and pain points, as well as the existing solutions (i.e. business models in the industry) will naturally lead to new ideas. How seriously you do your discovery homework using the tools in these Handbooks will determine not only how fast you create ideas, but about how likely these ideas are to succeed. Tools and methodologies covered include: 5 why questions, Affinity diagrams, attribute listing, brainwriting 6–3–5, cause-and-effect diagrams, creative problem solving model, design for tools, flowcharting, force field analysis, Kano analysis, nominal group technique, plan–do–check–act, reengineering/redesign, reverse engineering, robust design, SCAMPER, simulations, six thinking hats, social networks, solution analysis diagrams, statistical analysis, tree diagram, and value analysis. The authors believe that by making effective use of the tools and methodologies presented in this book, your organization can increase the percentage of creative/innovative ideas by five to eight times its present performance level.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781315350691'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1315350696'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 420, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Business & Economics'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=J4mKDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Gordon update our understanding of strategic warning intelligence analysis for the twenty-first century. Strategic warning—the process of long-range analysis to alert senior leaders to trending threats and opportunities that require action—is a critical intelligence function. It also is frequently misunderstood and underappreciated. Gentry and Gordon draw on both their practitioner and academic backgrounds to present a history of the strategic warning function in the US intelligence community. In doing so, they outline the capabilities of analytic methods, explain why strategic warning analysis is so hard, and discuss the special challenges strategic warning encounters from senior decision-makers. They also compare how strategic warning functions in other countries, evaluate why the United States has in recent years emphasized current intelligence instead of strategic warning, and recommend warning-related structural and procedural improvements in the US intelligence community.

It then uses the model to test whether there has been a structural break in consumption behavior because of the 2008 financial crisis. Before the crisis, the personal saving rate was trending downwards. However, in 2008 there was a significant rise in the saving rate that continued until the end of 2012, suggesting a permanent change in household behavior. To assess this issue formally, the unknown parameters of the model are estimated using data for 1961Q1-2007Q4, a period which precedes the crisis. The model is then used to predict the saving rate from 2008Q1 onwards and to assess whether the rise in the saving rate after 2008 was due to sizable, but transitory, income/wealth shocks or to changes in the underlying elasticities between saving and its determinants (hence structural). The statistical evidence suggests there was no structural break in the household saving behavior, implying that the rise in the saving rate during 2008-2012 was caused by the negative shocks to income, employment and wealth. This result explains why the saving rate resumed its decline in 2013, as real disposable income, employment and net worth recovered. Assuming that the real growth in these determinants remains strong, the estimated model predicts continued negative pressures on the current account deficit and further external imbalances attributable to the U.S. household sector.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781484360989'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1484360982'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 34, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Business & Economics'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xzBlDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

The feedback and the response regarding the previous editions has been overwhelming that has motivated the editorial team to bring out the present book. The topics chosen cover all the three specialties that are associated with anesthesiologists, i.e. anesthesia, pain and intensive care. The topics chosen are relevant at present times and would be useful for all the clinicians in the fields mentioned above. Of note would be one of the most trending topics of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS). Most of the hospitals in the world have adopted the guidelines for enhanced recovery and it is the time that the same practice be followed in the developing countries. One of the other present controversies in anesthesia is its effect on immune response in humans and one of the chapters in this edition highlights the present knowledge on this topic. Topics related to pharmacology include transdermal drug delivery, peripheral opioid receptors, opioid-induced hyperalgesia, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in obstetrics and present status of dexmedetomidine. Important areas of anesthesia practice such as nontechnical skills and medicolegal aspects, have also been covered in detail. Neurological complications of anesthesia and controversies regarding perioperative use of beta blockers have also been included in this edition. The incidence of malignancies in the world is rising and it is but natural that palliative care would become very important in pain practice. The chapter on management of palliative pain gives an overview of treatment modalities available for alleviation of such pain and should immensely benefit those in pain practice. Regional anesthesia in children has been covered by experts in the field. Pain issues in children in the perioperative period is another neglected area especially in the peripheral hospitals and the chapter on assessment of pain in children and management strategies of pain in this age group gives a summary of all the options available for improving pain management in children. The latest on the management of patients with pheochromocytoma, maxillofacial or brain trauma, anaphylaxis and those presenting for ophthalmic surgery, will be of interest to students as well as practicing anesthesiologists. Relevance of ICU-scoring systems and immune modulating diets has been discussed in detail. Lastly, the chapter on positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and lung recruitment in the intensive care would be very informative to the postgraduate students and those venturing into intensive care. As editors, we narrow down on the topics that we presume would be interesting for the readers. The Journal Scan covers commentary of experts on topics of interest published in reputed journals during the year. Feedbacks, suggestions and criticism regarding the present edition from our readers would be highly appreciated so that further editions could be improved.

The Mediterranean region is one of the most important regions for neotectonics and related natural hazards. This volume focuses on the neotectonics of the Eastern Mediterranean region, which has experienced many major extensive earthquakes, including the devastating Izmit, Turkey earthquake on August 17, 1999. The event lasted for 37 seconds, killing around 17,000 people, injuring 44,000 people, and leaving approximately half a million people homeless. Since then, several North American, European, and Turkish research groups have studied the neotectonics and earthquake potential of the region using different geological and geophysical methods, including GPS studies, geodesy, and passive source seismology. Some results from their studies were presented in major North American and European geological meetings. This volume highlights the work involving the Eastern Mediterranean region, which has one of the world's longest and best studied active strike-slip (horizontal motion) faults: the east-west trending North Anatolian fault zone, which is very similar to the San Andreas fault in California. This volume features discussions of: Widespread applications in measuring plate motion that have strong implications in predicting natural disasters like earthquakes, both on a regional and a global scale Recent motions, particularly those produced by earthquakes, that provide insights on the physics of earthquake recurrence, the growth of mountains, orogenic movements, and seismic hazards Unique methodical approaches in collecting tectonophysical data, including field, seismic, experimental, computer-based, and theoretical approaches.

Our experiences while vast and varied have at least one singular common denominator. From prostitutes to princesses, God loves us and has a place for us. No matter what kind of box society, the church, or our families desire to put us in, we have a life and a love far beyond our greatest imaginings right at our fingertips. I know this because the Bible tells me so. This is my opportunity to share with you what I have learned in the pages of God's Word. Through this book we will take a closer look at what womanhood is to the God who created it.

There are many strategies described in different markets. I define short-term trading (a.k.a. swing trading) into four categories: priced-based strategy, strategy-based strategy, sector rotation and momentum. They are all covered in this book. The first two are for beginners and experts alike. The last two are for advanced beginners and experts and they require more effort and knowledge; they should have more profit potentials but at higher risk. The duration of most strategies could be a few days to three months. Some rocket stocks could last for years. To me, \"buy-and-hold\" has been dead since 2000 and there are no evergreen strategies and no evergreen stocks. The priced-based strategy is sub divided into several strategies. First, we need to determine what the current market is. In a bull market, we trade stocks (preferably in the best sectors) that have simple indicators showing the market is trending up or down. In a bear market, we can short stocks, buy puts and/or contra ETFs betting the stock trending down. I started simple techniques that do not need charting as opposed to most other similar books and added more technical indicators. They are all available free from the internet. You should paper test your strategy and gradually and slowly increase your portfolio size. For short duration, we pay more attention to price movements and less to fundamentals. All the fundamental metrics, income statements, earnings...can be faked and/or manipulated but not the stock price with the exception of manipulations by big traders. It also applies to all news on the economy. The profit of the stock is better predicted by its price momentum. The price momentum also tells us when the momentum is reversed. Release date: 10/2017.

Literally. *** Whoever said living in California was glamorous and easy-going lied through their fucking teeth. I guess I can blame reality TV for that pervasive B.S. Maybe it was good thing my old man banned television at home for all the years he was alive, after all. I probably would’ve been even more deluded than I was when I’d moved up here from Arkansas three months ago. Looking back, I’m not even sure why I did it; why, of all the places I could’ve chosen to start a new life, I picked San Francisco: one of the most expensive places in the world to live. I don’t even know anyone one here. Heck, I’d never even visited the city before my move. Still, I’m determined to make it here, to make something of myself. And that means I have no time for distractions of any kind—especially guys. But then, he comes along; the sexiest, strongest, most handsome, most intimidating, and most powerful man I’ve ever seen. He’s absolutely gorgeous, with eyes that seem to burn right through my soul and the most charming smile in existence, and his allure, his entire being, is simply magnetic. He’s impossibly beautiful and just…ugh, perfect. He’s perfect. He’s everything every woman—and possibly quite a few men—wants, including me. What I’m not prepared for, though, is how much he wants me, too. However, there are three problems. One: He’s not a man. Two: I can only see him in my dreams. And three: He commands an army of soul reapers. And, apparently, that’s just the beginning… *** Immerse yourself in the fourth thrilling installment of Eme Strife's addictive, sexy, enchanting, and surreal series.

Shan Ruprai President APQO, National Chairman Australian Organisation for Quality, and Chairman AIBI Australia A Note from the Authors: Organizational Master Plans are tangible and often visible statements of where the organization is now, what it should be in the future and what is required to get there. While processes for developing them vary, master plans are most successful when they represent a vision that brings together the concerns of different interest groups, and their recommendations create a ground swell of business community and political support. Good Organizational Master Plans are flexible, and have involved the business leaders and other stakeholders from the outset, giving the plan a legitimate base, and a better chance to come to fruition. While circumstances vary from place to place, the decision to develop a master plan is often determined by the need to understand the current conditions of the marketplace, to generate and build stakeholder interest and participation, to create a new and common vision for the future, and/or to develop a clear and solid set of recommendations and implementation strategy. Susan Rademacher, executive director of the Louisville Olmsted Parks Conservancy, had this to say about the process of developing Louisville’s Organizational Master Plan: . . .When we got started with our master plan, there were a few important things that we focused on. One was that we started with a belief in the native intelligence of this community, from 1888 forward. And we invited the public to really dream about what these parks could be, what they remembered the parks as, and we tried to change expectations in that way. Typically in the past, ...the little changes that come about in parks are politically motivated to get a big bang in the short term for the next election. And ... our parks were suffering from that. So when we invited the community to dream large, we changed the expectations and also changed the expectations of what the public sector was looking to do.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781466558885'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1466558881'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 275, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Business & Economics'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bJK2bx0k4jMC&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Corley'], 'publisher': None, 'publishedDate': '2017', 'description': 'Narcissism is a fluid term in both clinical and cultural settings in America. Such fluidity contributes to a misunderstanding in regard to narcissism’s significant clinical aspects where diagnosis is concerned. Current personality research is trending towards accepting dimensional models of diagnosis. In regard to the diagnosis of Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD), such a dimensional model would benefit from descriptive phenotypes dedicated to highlighting characteristics of the narcissistic personality. Grandiose and vulnerable narcissism have become two of the most recognized subtypes of narcissism in current research literature. This research aims to contribute to the literature in the form of analyzing the two subtypes among a non-clinical population.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'OTHER', 'identifier': 'OCLC:987618740'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 248, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Clergy'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=f8jXswEACAAJ&dq=current+trending+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

      "item info :  {'title': 'Acoustic Monitoring of Earthquakes Along the Blanco Transform Fault Zone and Gorda Plate and Their Tectonic Implications', 'subtitle': None, 'authors': ['Robert P. Dziak'], 'publisher': None, 'publishedDate': '1997', 'description': \"Hydroacoustic tertiary (T- ) waves are seismically generated acoustic waves that propagate over great distances in the ocean sound channel with little loss in signal strength. Hydrophone recorded T-waves can provide a lower earthquake detection threshold and an improved epicenter location accuracy for oceanic earthquakes than land-based seismic networks. Thus detection and location of NE Pacific ocean earthquakes along the Blanco Transform Fault (BTFZ) and Gorda plate using the U.S. Navy's SOSUS (SOund SUrveillance System) hydrophone arrays afford greater insight into the current state of stress and crustal deformation mechanics than previously available. Acoustic earthquake information combined with bathymetry, submersible observations, earthquake source-parameter estimates, petrologic samples, and water-column chemistry renders a new tectonic view of the southern Juan de Fuca plate boundaries. Chapter 2 discusses development of seismo-acoustic analysis techniques using the well-documented April 1992 Cape Mendocino earthquake sequence. Findings include a hydrophone detection threshold estimate (M~2.4), and T-wave propagation path modeling to approximate earthquake acoustic source energy. Empirical analyses indicate that acoustic energy provides a reasonable magnitude and seismic moment estimate of oceanic earthquakes not detected by seismic networks. Chapters 3 documents a probable volcanogenic T-wave event swarm along a pull-apart basin within the western BTFZ during January 1994. Response efforts yielded evidence of anomalous water-column 3He concentrations, pillow-lava volcanism, and the first discovery of active hydrothermal vents along an oceanic fracture zone. Chapter 4 discusses the detection of a NE-SW trending microearthquake band along the mid-Gorda plate which was active from initiation of SOSUS recording in August 1991 through July 1992, then abruptly ceased. It is proposed that eventual termination of the Gorda plate seismicity band is due to strain reduction associated with the Cape Mendocino earthquake sequence. Chapter 5 combines bathymetric, hydro-acoustic, seismic, submersible, and gravity data to investigate the active tectonics of the transform parallel Blanco Ridge (BR), along the eastern BTFZ. The BR formation mechanism preferred here is uplift through strike-slip motion (with a normal component) followed by formation and intrusion of mantle-derived serpentinized-peridotite into the shallow ocean crust. The conclusion considers a potential link between the deformation patterns observed along the BTFZ and Gorda plate regions.\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'OTHER', 'identifier': 'UCSD:31822025536541'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 374, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Hydrophone'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=kdQSAQAAIAAJ&dq=current+trending+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

      "item info :  {'title': 'A Commonsense Revolution', 'subtitle': None, 'authors': ['Ben Murray Bruce'], 'publisher': 'Ezekiel Press', 'publishedDate': '2016-01-06', 'description': 'The ability for three words to communicate so much has been born out through history and unleashed some of the most powerful revolutions the world has seen. A \"Common Sense Revolution\" by Senator Ben Murray-Bruce is also three words with the potential to fundamentally change the future of a country, but with more in common with the type of peaceful revolution created by Thatcher than Robespierre or Lenin. There have been many times when the words \\'a new type of politics\\' have been uttered only to be a fleeting moment of optimism before everything reverts to type. However there is something remarkably fresh and new about how Ben Murray-Bruce has caught the public\\'s imagination in Africa\\'s most populous nation. He is not the \\'common man\\', to do what he has done is indeed most uncommon, but he has managed to touch a nerve and communicate to the people of Nigeria in a way that has reached out to all irrespective of State or religion. Communication is not just about speeches, oratory prowess or, even in today\\'s world, how well you tweet. It is a two-way street where it as important to listen as well as to speak. The very title of this book is testimony to that as it emerged from a trending hashtag, #commonsenserevolution that was created by the people of Nigeria in response to Ben Murray-Bruce\\'s ongoing narrative on events based on his simple theme of: \"I just want to make common sense.\" Ben Murray-Bruce heard the people and acted. And we can see that in how he addresses each issue where he combines leadership with responsiveness, to create quite a unique and powerful blend of communication. Time and time again he hits the bullseye across the nation, whether it is challenging Ministers to reduce government waste by, for example, not flying First Class or donating his Senatorial Clothing Allowance to impoverished women. These individual actions are not unrelated topical or tactical initiatives but are informed and driven by his very clear belief in the need for the very fabric of Nigerian society to change. At his speech at Silverbird Group\\'s 35th Anniversary he made the case clearly and powerfully that the biggest division in Nigeria is not between North and South or between Muslim and Christian, but between Rich and Poor. With the peaceful transition of power in 2015 the people of Nigeria have seen that their vote can count, but unless they see the benefit that change will count for nothing. Ben Murray\\'s Bruce\\'s current contribution is to hold to account a Government that promised change so that the people\\'s hopes and aspirations are not dashed once more on the rocks of \\'politics as usual\\'. As has already been pointed out, Nigeria recently surpassed South Africa as the continent\\'s largest economy. What is less widely known is that by 2019 it will be more than twice its size and will be one of the world\\'s top 20 economies. Ben Murray-Bruce believes it is Common Sense that the common man should finally share in this prosperity and if not we will see a different type of Revolution that will make what happened in France over 200 years ago look like an amuse bouche. I have been to Nigeria 46 times and have been hugely impressed by the intelligence, ingenuity and exuberance of every Nigerian I meet, but who for so long has been manacled by a corrupt elite and ineffective government. And in Ben Murray-Bruce the people have been impressed by a man who they believe can help free them to realise their potential. Ben Murray-Bruce\\'s vision is to create a Nigeria where every citizen will be judged not from the State they come from but where they are going. Ben Murray Bruce\\'s Common Sense Revolution is to show how Nigeria can become a country where, to paraphrase Cicero on Rome, everyone will be able to claim \"Civis Nigerianus sum\" and expect - and deserve - to be treated fairly and equally. -Michael Moszynki', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0996871594'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780996871594'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 112, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': None, 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=Ej4ijwEACAAJ&dq=current+trending+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

From the corner of my eye, I catch Dr. Frost staring at me, his own eyes intent and unwavering, and he’s eerily silent. I can’t even begin to imagine what he’s thinking. I probably don’t even want to know. I really just need to get this over with before I panic and change my mind again. I hold my breath as my eyes flutter closed. I feel my hand move on its own accord, gripping the pen tightly. All it takes is two seconds. And then it’s done.

      "item info :  {'title': 'Doctor-Patient Confidentiality: Volume Four (Confidential #1)', 'authors': ['Eme Strife'], 'publisher': '(Eme)nded Publishing', 'publishedDate': '2014-12-31', 'description': 'Two very different people. One scandalous proposition. Endless possibilities... *** My eyes burn. Really badly. They\\'ve been burning since yesterday morning, ever since my eyes landed on what was inside that damn folder. And they continued to burn through today\\'s morning practice and all my classes. And they\\'re still burning now, probably even more than they were before as I stomp through the main hallway of the surgical center. \"Excuse me, Miss, you can\\'t go through there,\" I hear a female voice call after me, but I don\\'t stop. \"Miss, office hours are over. You cannot go in there!\" she repeats. Her words still don\\'t stop me. I can\\'t stop. Not when I\\'m cranky and pissed off and the very cause of my crankiness and anger is right here in this building. I hear her shuffle behind me, presumably to chase after me. But I still keep going. I didn\\'t sleep last night. I couldn’t. At all. Not even for a little bit. And now my feet won\\'t stop moving. My fingers won\\'t stop twitching. And my fucking eyes won\\'t stop burning behind my glasses. I ride up the elevator and bend into a familiar corridor, practically stomping the entire way there, and I push the door open without a second thought. My eyes immediately land on my target. Dexter fucking Frost. *** Feast your eyeballs and fall absolutely head over heels in love with Eme Strife\\'s edgy, sizzling, intriguing, incredibly sexy, and captivating unconventional romance story. Each installment will keep you strapped to the very edge of your seat and constantly guessing on one hell of an emotional roller-coaster. You\\'ll never think of the phrase, \"Doctor-Patient Confidentiality”, in the same way ever again once you read this! This story unfolds over several volumes. IT IS NOT A STANDALONE. This is the fourth book. Rated 18+ This series contains mature and adult content (nudity, graphic sex, and strong language). Because of its explicit nature, it is intended for mature audiences only. Reader discretion is advised.

Seymour'], 'publisher': None, 'publishedDate': '2017', 'description': 'Gathers current research on the understudied late mobile groups of the American Southwest and provides directions for future investigations Trending upward as an archaeological field of study, protohistoric mobile groups provide fascinating new directions for cutting-edge research in the American Southwest and beyond. These mobile residents represent the ancient and ancestral roots of many modern indigenous peoples, including the Apaches, Jumano, Yavapai, and Ute. These important protohistoric and historic mobile people have tended to be ignored because their archaeological sites were deemed too difficult to identify, too scant to be worthy of study, and too different to incorporate. This book brings together information from a diverse collection of authors working throughout the American Southwest and its fringes to make the bold statement that these groups can be identified in the archaeological record and their sites have much to contribute to the study of cultural process, method and theory, and past lifeways. The period is much more complex than previously thought and requires the application of innovative and keen approaches, as discussed in this volume. Mobile groups are integral for assessing the grand reorganizational events of the Late Prehistoric period and are key to understanding colonial contact and transformations. Now, the only analyses, overviews, and class lectures that will be considered comprehensive will be those that address the presence of these many widespread mobile peoples.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1607815222'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781607815228'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 372, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['HISTORY'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=jmGstAEACAAJ&dq=current+trending+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Literally. *** Whoever said living in California was glamorous and easy-going lied through their fucking teeth. I guess I can blame reality TV for that pervasive B.S. Maybe it was good thing my old man banned television at home for all the years he was alive, after all. I probably would’ve been even more deluded than I was when I’d moved up here from Arkansas three months ago. Looking back, I’m not even sure why I did it; why, of all the places I could’ve chosen to start a new life, I picked Los Angeles: one of the most expensive places in the world to live. I don’t even know anyone one here. Heck, I’d never even visited the city before my move. Still, I’m determined to make it here, to make something of myself. And that means I have no time for distractions of any kind—especially guys. But then, he comes along; the sexiest, strongest, most handsome, most intimidating, and most powerful man I’ve ever seen. He’s absolutely gorgeous, with eyes that seem to burn right through my soul and the most charming smile in existence, and his allure, his entire being, is simply magnetic. He’s impossibly beautiful and just…ugh, perfect. He’s perfect. He’s everything every woman—and possibly quite a few men—wants, including me. What I’m not prepared for, though, is how much he wants me, too. However, there are three problems. One: He’s not a man. Two: I can only see him in my dreams. And three: He commands an army of soul reapers. And, apparently, that’s just the beginning… *** Immerse yourself in the first thrilling bundle of installments of Eme Strife's addictive, sexy, enchanting, and surreal series. Each page will leave you even more enthralled than the last, on the edge of your seat, and vigorously chomping at the bit for more. This series unfolds over several volumes. IT IS NOT A STANDALONE. Rated 18+ This series contains graphic sexual content, violence, and strong language. Because of its explicit nature, it is intended for mature audiences only.

I\\'m even unable to blink as I behold the tall, imposing man standing at my grandmother\\'s doorstep. *** Feast your eyeballs and fall absolutely head over heels in love with Eme Strife\\'s edgy, sizzling, intriguing, incredibly sexy, and captivating unconventional romance story. Each installment will keep you strapped to the very edge of your seat and constantly guessing on one hell of an emotional roller-coaster. You\\'ll never think of the phrase, \"Doctor-Patient Confidentiality”, in the same way ever again once you read this! This story unfolds over several volumes. IT IS NOT A STANDALONE. This is the third book. Rated 18+ This series contains mature and adult content (nudity, graphic sex, and strong language). Because of its explicit nature, it is intended for mature audiences only. Reader discretion is advised.

First, it teaches the importance of using sophisticated yet accessible statistical methods to evaluate a trading system before it is put to real-world use. In order to accommodate readers having limited mathematical background, these techniques are illustrated with step-by-step examples using actual market data, and all examples are explained in plain language. Second, this book shows how the free program TSSB (Trading System Synthesis & Boosting) can be used to develop and test trading systems. The machine learning and statistical algorithms available in TSSB go far beyond those available in other off-the-shelf development software. Intelligent use of these state-of-the-art techniques greatly improves the likelihood of obtaining a trading system whose impressive backtest results continue when the system is put to use in a trading account. Among other things, this book will teach the reader how to: Estimate future performance with rigorous algorithms Evaluate the influence of good luck in backtests Detect overfitting before deploying your system Estimate performance bias due to model fitting and selection of seemingly superior systems Use state-of-the-art ensembles of models to form consensus trade decisions Build optimal portfolios of trading systems and rigorously test their expected performance Search thousands of markets to find subsets that are especially predictable Create trading systems that specialize in specific market regimes such as trending/flat or high/low volatility More information on the TSSB program can be found at TSSBsoftware dot com.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '148950771X'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781489507716'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 520, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Business & Economics'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=lqKCnQEACAAJ&dq=current+trending+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Providing an up-to-date survey of the recent developments in periodic time series, the book presents a large number of empirical results. The first part of the book deals with model selection, diagnostic checking and forecasting of univariate periodic autoregressive models. Tests for periodic integration, are discussed, and an extensive discussion of the role of deterministic regressors in testing for periodic integration and in forecasting is provided. The second part discusses multivariate periodic autoregressive models. It provides an overview of periodic cointegration models, as these are the most relevant. This overview contains single-equation type tests and a full-system approach based on generalized method of moments. All methods are illustrated with extensive examples, and the book will be of interest to advanced graduate students and researchers in econometrics, as well as practitioners looking for an understanding of how to approach seasonal data.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780191529269'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0191529265'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 162, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Business & Economics'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KeHnLgWXPb4C&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Agrigento, October 1-3, 2009', 'authors': ['Annamaria Bartolotta'], 'publisher': 'Peeters Pub & Booksellers', 'publishedDate': '2014', 'description': \"Despite the difficulties of reconstructing the grammar of a dead language, studying Ancient Greek offers new insights for linguistic theory. The morphological complexity of the Greek verb with its highly intricate inflectional system provide a valuable basis for an in-depth-analysis of the mechanisms which regulate the functioning of a language. Studies on the Ancient Greek verb have also contributed significantly to the reconstruction of the Indo-European language since the early history of Linguistics in the nineteenth century. The conservative features preserved in the oldest stages of Greek allow us to rely on a solid basis to which every linguist must refer in investigating a model of the Proto-Indo-European verb. The present volume contains the papers presented at the 8th International Meeting on Greek Linguistics (GL8) held in Agrigento in October 2009, hosted by the University of Palermo, Italy. The conference was part of a series of biennial international meetings on Ancient Greek Linguistics organized in Italy since 1993. It was entitled 'The Greek Verb: Morphology, Syntax, Semantics' and was aimed at discussing trending issues on the Ancient Greek verbal system from a perspective both synchronic and diachronic. The contributions of this book analyze phonological, morphological, syntactic and semantic phenomena from various areas of grammar pertaining to the verb, using a large corpus which ranges mostly from Homeric to Classical Greek. There is diversity in the topics covered, but the approach which unifies the volume is that of challenging traditional divisions and rigid boundaries between different levels of analysis, focusing on fundamental issues in theoretically-based linguistics from a broad perspective: morphosyntactic and syntactic variation, phonological, morphological, semantic and pragmatic aspects of grammatical phenomena. The papers also adopt different theoretical frameworks, both synchronic and diachronic, and develop diverse approaches varying from the cognitive (prototype theory), and the formal (Distributed Morphology), to the pragmatic-functional, and the historical-comparative. This volume provides a current overview of some work on Ancient Greek Linguistics, setting forth interesting topics for further research and drawing more attention to the contribution which historical linguistics and the study of dead languages can give to the improvement and growth of linguistic theories, toward a deeper comprehension of the language system.\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '9042927224'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9789042927223'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 352, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Foreign Language Study'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=5uREnQEACAAJ&dq=current+trending+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

The feedback and the response regarding the previous editions has been overwhelming that has motivated the editorial team to bring out the present book. The topics chosen cover all the three specialties that are associated with anesthesiologists, i.e. anesthesia, pain and intensive care. The topics chosen are relevant at present times and would be useful for all the clinicians in the fields mentioned above. Of note would be one of the most trending topics of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS). Most of the hospitals in the world have adopted the guidelines for enhanced recovery and it is the time that the same practice be followed in the developing countries. One of the other present controversies in anesthesia is its effect on immune response in humans and one of the chapters in this edition highlights the present knowledge on this topic. Topics related to pharmacology include transdermal drug delivery, peripheral opioid receptors, opioid-induced hyperalgesia, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in obstetrics and present status of dexmedetomidine. Important areas of anesthesia practice such as nontechnical skills and medicolegal aspects, have also been covered in detail. Neurological complications of anesthesia and controversies regarding perioperative use of beta blockers have also been included in this edition. The incidence of malignancies in the world is rising and it is but natural that palliative care would become very important in pain practice. The chapter on management of palliative pain gives an overview of treatment modalities available for alleviation of such pain and should immensely benefit those in pain practice. Regional anesthesia in children has been covered by experts in the field. Pain issues in children in the perioperative period is another neglected area especially in the peripheral hospitals and the chapter on assessment of pain in children and management strategies of pain in this age group gives a summary of all the options available for improving pain management in children. The latest on the management of patients with pheochromocytoma, maxillofacial or brain trauma, anaphylaxis and those presenting for ophthalmic surgery, will be of interest to students as well as practicing anesthesiologists. Relevance of ICU-scoring systems and immune modulating diets has been discussed in detail. Lastly, the chapter on positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and lung recruitment in the intensive care would be very informative to the postgraduate students and those venturing into intensive care. As editors, we narrow down on the topics that we presume would be interesting for the readers. The Journal Scan covers commentary of experts on topics of interest published in reputed journals during the year. Feedbacks, suggestions and criticism regarding the present edition from our readers would be highly appreciated so that further editions could be improved. We take this opportunity to express our gratitude to all the contributors to this volume and to the reviewers for their constructive criticism.

Many causes of rotor vibration are so subtle and pervasive that excessive vibration continues to occur despite the use of usually effective design practices and methods of avoidance. Rotating Machinery Vibration: From Analysis to Troubleshooting provides a comprehensive, consolidated overview of the fundamentals of rotating machinery vibration and addresses computer model building, sources and types of vibration, and machine vibration signal analysis. This reference is a powerful tool to strengthen vital in-house competency on the subject for professionals in a variety of fields. After presenting governing fundamental principles and background on modern measurement, computational tools, and troubleshooting methods, the author provides practical instruction and demonstration on how to diagnose vibration problems and formulate solutions. The topic is covered in four sequential sections: Primer on Rotor Vibration, Use of Rotor Dynamic Analyses, Monitoring and Diagnostics, and Troubleshooting Case Studies. This book includes comprehensive descriptions of vibration symptoms for rotor unbalance, dynamic instability, rotor-stator rubs, misalignment, loose parts, cracked shafts, and rub-induced thermal bows. It is an essential reference for mechanical, chemical, design, manufacturing, materials, aerospace, and reliability engineers. Particularly useful as a reference for specialists in vibration, rotating machinery, and turbomachinery, it also makes an ideal text for upper-level undergraduate and graduate students in these disciplines.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781439847558'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '143984755X'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 476, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Technology & Engineering'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=QW4IX6Odi3MC&dq=current+trending+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

The ridge has been described as an erosional divide separating the Eastern and Western Lowlands of the Mississippi River Valley in Arkansas. However, north-south trending faults have been proposed along the east and west ridge margins based on seismic reflection lines. Based on changes in Pliocene Upland Complex gravel elevations, previous studies have also proposed east-west striking normal faults within Crowley's Ridge. In this current study, lignite exploration electric and lithologic logs and water well logs were interpreted on and adjacent to the northern half of Crowley's Ridge. Three internal faults trend north-south within Crowley's Ridge. Additionally, east-west trending cross sections revealed approximately 30m of displaced Eocene strata across the eastern and western ridge margins, which support the interpretation of post-Eocene tectonic uplift of Crowley's Ridge.\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'OTHER', 'identifier': 'OCLC:971628672'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': None, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': None, 'averageRating': 5.0, 'ratingsCount': 1, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=eDvltAEACAAJ&dq=current+trending+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

The bands accomplish this by showing whether prices are high with the use of an upper band, and whether they are low with the use of a lower band. The bands are based on the volatility (standard deviation) of the past price data. This indicator can aid in rigorous pattern recognition and is useful in comparing current price action to possible buy and sell signals, helping to arrive at a self-contained systematic trading decision. However, due to its inherent characteristics, the indicator can provide false signals during trading in some trending markets. The research in this thesis develops two modified models, one combining neural networks with the Bollinger Bands technical indicator, and another incorporating a GARCH-in-mean model with the Bollinger Bands technical indicator to predict and trade on the security trend. The assumption of the combined system is that the neural network or GARCH model will help to overcome the lagging aspects of the Bollinger Bands indicator by providing a next day forecast, allowing the trader to make the correct trading decisions. The profitability of the model is tested using 10 American stocks and indexes\"--Abstract, leaf iii.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'OTHER', 'identifier': 'OCLC:72440306'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 172, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Investment analysis'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=pqc5OAAACAAJ&dq=current+trending+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

It is both diagnostic in that it examines the risk of nuclear weapons use, as well as prescriptive in offering some remedies. It discerns an overall pattern in which risks are generally trending in the wrong direction in today's security environment of proliferation, nuclear build-ups in Asia, spreading extremism, burgeoning cyber warfare, exploitable nuclear command and control networks, vulnerable and insecure nuclear weapons storage sites and delivery platforms (particularly silo-based strategic missiles), and de-stabilizing global military competition featuring rapid innovation in weapons technology and modalities of warfare. In the current environment, much needs to be done to reduce nuclear risks. The slope from a crisis to nuclear brinksmanship to escalation to the use of nuclear weapons with cascading global implications is a much too steep and slippery one.\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'OTHER', 'identifier': 'OCLC:908192313'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 89, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Ballistic missiles'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=dcFjrgEACAAJ&dq=current+trending+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Department of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering', 'OhioLINK Electronic Theses and Dissertations Center'], 'publisher': None, 'publishedDate': '2013', 'description': 'Abstract: One significant drawback of the commercial passive and microprocessored prosthetic devices, the inability of delivering positive energy when needed, is due to the absence of the knee flexion during stance phase. Moreover, consequences such as circumduction and disturbed gait pattern take place due to the improper energy flow at the knee and the absence of the positive energy delivery during the swing phase. Current generation powered design has solved these problems by delivering the needed energy with heavy battery demanding motors, which increase the mass of the device significantly. Hence, the gait quality of transfemoral amputees has not improved significantly in the last 50 years due to the inefficient energy flow distribution causing the patient to hike his/her pelvis, which leads to back pain in the long run. In this context, state-of-art prosthetics technology is trending toward creating energy regenerative devices, which are able to harvest/ return energy during ambulation by a spring mechanism, since a spring not only permits significant power demand reduction but also provides high power-to-weight ratio. This study will examine the sagittal plane knee moment versus knee flexion angle properties robotically, clinically and theoretically to explore the functional stiffness of a healthy knee as well as a prosthetic knee during the energy return and harvest phases of gait. With this intention, a prosthetic knee test method will be developed for investigating the torque-angle properties of the knee by iteratively modifying the hip trajectory until achieving the closest to healthy knee biomechanics by a 3-Degree of Freedom (DOF) Simulator. This research reveals that constant spring stiffness is suboptimal to varying gait requirements for different types of activity, due to the variability of the power requirements of the knee caused by the passive, viscous and elastic characteristics and the activation dependent properties of the muscles. Exploring this variation is crucial for the design of transfemoral prosthetic devices that aim to mimic normal gait. This research will contribute to a better understanding of determination of the prosthetic knee design strategy; hence, by using modern computational tools, a prosthetic knee device could be simulated even before initiating the hardware design process.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'OTHER', 'identifier': 'OCLC:868322942'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 93, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Artificial knee'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=tKlAngEACAAJ&dq=current+trending+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

The Oligocene middle Frio Formation is one of the major progradational units within the Stratton field. It is characterized by rapid deposition and high subsidence rates that create complex internal facies architecture. The reservoir facies architecture of the middle Frio Formation is described as channel-fill deposits, crevasses-splay deposits, and floodplain mudstones. Previous two-dimensional seismic studies indicate some level of compartmentalization. Three-dimensional seismic and well log data provided by the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas at Austin were utilized to identify by-passed, untapped, incompletely drained, and new infield reserves. North-South trending features were observed within the basal middle Frio Formations, and are interpreted as residual effects from the deeper Vicksburg Faults. Correlation of the traced horizons and well log data revealed two structural highs in the C-38 time structure map that also appear as high amplitude corresponding to the presence of gas in the reservoir. Two structural closures described as Prospect A and Prospect B were evaluated. For Prospect A, volumetric calculations gave an in-place gas reserves of 501 mmcf and recoverable gas reserves of 351 mmcf. For Prospect B, they yielded an in-place gas reserves of 487 mmcf and recoverable gas reserves of 341 mmcf.

Cultural Forests of the Amazon is a comprehensive and diverse account of how indigenous people transformed landscapes and managed resources in the most extensive region of tropical forests in the world. Until recently, most scholars and scientists, as well as the general public, thought indigenous people had a minimal impact on Amazon forests, once considered to be total wildernesses. William Balé e’ s research, conducted over a span of three decades, shows a more complicated truth. In Cultural Forests of the Amazon, he argues that indigenous people, past and present, have time and time again profoundly transformed nature into culture. Moreover, they have done so using their traditional knowledge and technology developed over thousands of years. Balé e demonstrates the inestimable value of indigenous knowledge in providing guideposts for a potentially less destructive future for environments and biota in the Amazon. He shows that we can no longer think about species and landscape diversity in any tropical forest without taking into account the intricacies of human history and the impact of all forms of knowledge and technology.

It states that securities prices in financial markets must equal fundamental values, either because all investors are rational or because arbitrage eliminates pricing anomalies. This book describes an alternative approach to the study of financial markets: behavioral finance. This approach starts with an observation that the assumptions of investor rationality and perfect arbitrage are overwhelmingly contradicted by both psychological and institutional evidence. In actual financial markets, less than fully rational investors trade against arbitrageurs whose resources are limited by risk aversion, short horizons, and agency problems. The book presents and empirically evaluates models of such inefficient markets. Behavioral finance models both explain the available financial data better than does the efficient markets hypothesis and generate new empirical predictions. These models can account for such anomalies as the superior performance of value stocks, the closed end fund puzzle, the high returns on stocks included in market indices, the persistence of stock price bubbles, and even the collapse of several well-known hedge funds in 1998. By summarizing and expanding the research in behavioral finance, the book builds a new theoretical and empirical foundation for the economic analysis of real-world markets.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780191606892'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0191606898'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 224, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Business & Economics'], 'averageRating': 5.0, 'ratingsCount': 1, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vIP4y-luYoIC&source=gbs_api'}\n",

The increasing average age of populations does not only affect social systems, countries and communities, but also has a strong impact on the work of businesses and companies. The decline in demographic fitness will not only hit countries like the U.S., the Western European countries, or Japan, but also the upcoming societies in China or in the Eastern European countries. In many of these countries, during three or four decades the average age will grow from about 40 years now to about 50 years. Where experts are needed, this may result in an increase of the workforce's age of between 5 and 10 years in only one decade. For companies thus, a number of challenges arise that have to be overcome fast and continuously. The main topics in this field will be new strategies in leadership, new concepts in health management, new ways in knowledge management and learning, as well as new models how to drive ideas for diversity and innovation. On the one hand, enterprises therefore will have to invest in their aging employees for supporting their talents, helping them to learn and keeping them in the company. On the other, they will have to increase productivity, keep on searching for new products, and integrate experts from abroad. This has to be combined with new ways of strategies and HR management.

It's a pretty big deal too, since if you back down and choose not to fight now, you will probably only need to fight twice as hard in the future when it bites you in the culo somehow. Then you'll have placed forth twice the effort only to only fall twice as hard in defeat in the end, whereas now, you can beat it with relative ease with just a little concerted effort and concentration. Sweating has officially arrived as that big new Diet for success! It is here, and it's here to stay! For its basis was well over needed, and its relevancy never before so apparent. Welcome to the world of Powercycles68 and becoming Lead free!! Most of all, welcome to the start of your new age. Starting slow and finishing fast is what the Powercycle68 is all about. You can grow your body, mind, and spirit to unseen heights just by starting now as opposed to later! I've personally taken it to the extreme with over 2800 Powercycle68 sessions to conclude that we are built to go through a self-healing process with hard physical exertion. Perception, Science, Facts, Mathematics, and Testimony all come together to show just how undermined this process really is. The conclusive magic of the Powercycle 68 Gold Zone is ridiculous on just how well it heels the mind, and positively influences all your bodies' core functions. If it didn't, would I be standing next to you now with a silly picture of me before and after a session? No! I wouldn't. Everything changes for the better, everything! With ease as well, as you become an upgraded SuperYOU from completely balancing out your body. This is going to be HUGE for the future health goals of everyone worldwide. The all natural miracle drug has set sail on curing all who embrace! This represents a spiritual roll down ladder from our divine creators themselves, to help us achieve the utmost pinnacle in our lives. One that shines with your glory and eternal happiness.

One out of every two modern marriages ends in divorce, and 75 percent of those divorces are initiated by wives. Author Ashton Applewhite is one of these women, having sued for divorce after enduring an unfulfilling ten-year marriage. Cutting Loose is an essential resource for women who want to leave their marriage but fear the consequences. Shattering the media-generated image of the lonely, deprived and financially strapped divorcee, Applewhite provides a much needed reality check. Cutting Loose introduces 50 women, varying in age, race, class and predicament, who have thrived after initiating their own divorces. Their fears of financial, emotional and romantic ruin were never realized; on the contrary, their lives improved immeasurably, and their self-esteem soared. Cutting Loose also answers the crucial questions: How do you finally decide to make the big break? What is getting divorced really like? What are the shortcomings of the legal process? What about custody and child support? Financial and emotional survival? And how does a woman\\'s self-image change during and after divorce? \"Ending any kind of oppression takes belief in self. Cutting Loose offers moving evidence of how such belief works, whether in a relationship or walking the road alone. Perceptive, realistic, and wise, the book is of enormous practical value to both women and men who aspire to more equal and fulfilling relationships.\"—Laura Day, author of Practical Intuition', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780062680716'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0062680714'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 336, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Family & Relationships'], 'averageRating': 5.0, 'ratingsCount': 1, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GIxPDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

The same is true of geophysics, whose specialties (seismology, gravimetIy, magnetics, magnetotellurics) deal only with the laws that govern them, and not with those that govern geology's postulates. The branch of geology and geophysics called tectonophysics is not a formalized discipline or subdiscipline, and, therefore, has no formal laws or theorems of its own. Although many recent books claim to be textbooks in tectonophysics, they are not; they are books designed to explain one hypothesis, just as the present book is designed to explain one hypothesis. The textbook that comes closest to being a textbook of tectonophysics is Peter 1. Wyllie's (1971) book, The Dynamic Earth. Teachers, students, and practitioners of geology since the very beginning of earth science teaching have avoided the development of a rigorous (but not rigid) scientific approach to tectonics, largely because we earth scientists have not fully understood the origin of the features with which we are dealing. This fact is not at all surprising when one considers that the database for hypotheses and theories of tectonics, particularly before 1960, has been limited to a small part of the exposed land area on the Earth's surface.\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0792341562'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780792341567'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 326, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Science'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=IVIBPWyT7BkC&dq=current+trending+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

With one exception, the remaining articles describe individual EBP projects from five different health care facilities that used the Iowa Model to guide their work. Each article includes an evidence summary, a description of implementation strategies, an evaluation of the innovation, and lessons learned. These completed projects were initiated between 2009 and 2012, address a variety of topical nursing issues, and, for the most part, focus on preventing complications (ie, blood sugar elevations, increased lengths of stay, extubation failures, noise-related injury, pain, surgical site infections, pneumonia, restraint use, delirium, and fever). An additional article describes the use of evidence to inform simulation-based learning, a possible strategy for ensuring competencies in and compliance with EBP interventions. Nursing leaders will come away with solid information about utilizing EBP to improve patient outcomes. The Hawaii program demonstrates that health care quality can be realized by employing the best available evidence and empowering the nursing workforce. It also offers a glimpse of the care that the future nursing workforce could provide to create a health system that provides accessible, affordable and quality care to everyone in the United States.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780323323345'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0323323340'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 484, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Medical'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xSN1BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

It\\'s not overvalued today; it\\'s undervalued. The hard work required for its success has been misunderstood and misrepresented. The first part of the book establishes that case and analyzes the pros and cons of current, varying philosophies and approaches, merging their best aspects into the holistic approach demonstrated by Christ. Part 2 introduces Attachment Relationship Ministry (ARM), a lens distinguishing four primary adolescent relational styles depending on how secure or insecure teens are with God and parents. Part 3 encourages strategic relational ministry sensitive to those styles, explaining why youth leader efforts succeed or fail. Chapters offer realistic discipleship and evangelism suggestions depending on attachment styles and practically empowering youth workers (volunteers, newbies, experts, and interns) to focus energy and time more wisely. These recommendations relate to spiritual formation, leadership selection, parental approach, and trending issues, such as ministry to LGBTQIA teens. For too many teens today, feeling insecure in crisis is a way of life. Learn how to take what you\\'ve done well and make it better. All church leaders should read this book, logging the critical importance of providing ministry specifically targeting teenagers today. \"\"Ron Belsterling has been a respected voice among those of us who train college students for youth ministry for years. In this book he offers readers a gift of scholarship, passion, thoughtfulness, creativity, and encouragement . . .

But for some of us, it really doesn\\'t feel that way . . . Ron speaks with the authority of one who has been there, done it, and collected the coffee travel mug \\'lifer\\' award. He is passionate about youth and is a welcome voice in pushing back on those hunting for easy targets.\"\" --Andy du Feu, Moorlands College, Christchurch, UK \"\"Ron Belsterling imparts seasoned and time-tested youth ministry wisdom that will help us well as we equip kids for a lifetime of passionately seeking, loving, and serving Christ. For the seasoned youth worker, this book will rekindle your passion by challenging you to think in new ways about youth ministry. And for those just starting out, Ron will help you build a strong ministry foundation that will serve you well.\"\" --Walt Mueller, author of 99 Thoughts for Parents of Teenagers \"\"Ron Belsterling is a seasoned veteran of both youth ministry and of research on relationships and how they impact people\\'s relationship with God . . . He brings a deep understanding of how relationships develop, what hinders securely attached relationships, and how youth ministry ought to be done with youth who have different past experiences in relationships with their parents and with God.\"\" --Kevin Lawson, author of Supervising and Supporting Ministry Staff \"\"Equipping the next generations to follow Christ is the highest calling of ministry. In this thorough overview, Ron Belsterling has captured this biblical vision and offered an inspirational call to youth ministry coupled with a practical, strategic guidebook. At a time when many communities are worried about the well-being of teenagers . . . A Defense of Youth Ministry is a remarkably refreshing resource.\"\" --Ken Castor, author of Grow Down; Make a Difference \"\"I hope this book is seen for what it is, an intense look at the needs and means of reaching and leading the next generation . . .

The number of users on applications from Facebook to Twitter and Instagram continues to increase in all demographics. These tools are being integrated into our daily activities and challenging boundaries, roles, and even possibilities globally. Currently, there exists a gap in developing competent leaders capable of leading change using social media. Education leaders and leadership education programs can adapt the values of the Social Change Model to reflect and apply digital competencies to their practice. Digital leadership requires reflection on online self‐awareness and congruence, grappling with the controversy that comes with cyber civility and how to be a digital citizen prepared to inspire positive social change.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'OTHER', 'identifier': 'OCLC:1053712288'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': None, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': None, 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=EAjcvQEACAAJ&dq=current+trending+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

An interaction emerged between tDCS type and high/low WM capacity groups. Low WM capacity participants benefited from HD-tDCS compared to tDCS. Group differences should be taken into account to understand the stimulation effects. Abstract: There is growing interest in non-invasive brain stimulation techniques. A drawback is that the relationship between stimulation and cognitive outcomes for various tasks are unknown. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) provides diffuse current spread, whereas high-definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) provides more targeted current. The direction of behavioral effects after tDCS can be difficult to predict in cognitive realms such as attention and working memory (WM). Previously, we showed that in low and high WM capacity groups tDCS modulates performance in nearly equal and opposite directions on a change detection task, with improvement for the high capacity participants alone. Here, we used the retro-cue paradigm to test attentional shifting among items in WM to investigate whether WM capacity (WMC) predicted different behavioral consequences during anodal tDCS or HD-tDCS to posterior parietal cortex (PPC). In two experiments, with 24 participants each, we used different stimulus categories (colored circles, letters) and stimulation sites (right, left PPC). The results showed a significant (Experiment 1) or trending (Experiment 2) WMC x stimulation interaction. Compared to tDCS, after HD-tDCS the retro-cueing benefit was significantly greater for the low WMC group but numerically worse for the high WMC group. These data highlight the importance of considering group differences when using non-invasive neurostimulation techniques.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'OTHER', 'identifier': 'OCLC:1052063373'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': None, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': None, 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=RTEHvgEACAAJ&dq=current+trending+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

The Cache Valley is a structural graben of the northern portion of the Basin and Range Province, just south of the border with the Eastern Snake River Plain (ESRP). This is a known geothermal resource area (KGRA) that was evaluated in the 1970's by the State of Idaho Department of Water Resources (IDWR) and by exploratory wells drilled by Sunedco Energy Development. The resource is poorly defined but current interpretations suggest that it is associated with the Cache Valley structural graben. Thermal waters moving upward along steeply dipping northwest trending basin and range faults emanate in numerous hot springs in the area. Springs reach temperatures as hot as 84° C. Traditional geothermometry models estimated reservoir temperatures of approximately 125° C in the 1970's study. In January of 2014, interest was renewed in the areas when a water well drilled to 79 m (260 ft) yielded a bottom hole temperature of 104° C (217° F). The well was sampled in June of 2014 to investigate the chemical composition of the water for modeling geothermometry reservoir temperature. Traditional magnesium corrected Na-K-Ca geothermometry estimates this new well to be tapping water from a thermal reservoir of 227° C (440° F). Even without the application of improved predictive methods, the results indicate much higher temperatures present at much shallower depths than previously thought. This new data provides strong support for further investigation and sampling of wells and springs in the Northern Cache Valley, proposed for the summer of 2015. The results of the water will be analyzed utilizing a new multicomponent equilibrium geothermometry (MEG) tool called Reservoir Temperature Estimate (RTEst) to obtain an improved estimate of the reservoir temperature. The new data suggest that other KGRAs and overlooked areas may need to be investigated using improved geothermal exploration methods.\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'OTHER', 'identifier': 'OCLC:1066357213'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': None, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': None, 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=zdfVwQEACAAJ&dq=current+trending+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Methods: Of the 152 institutions to which councilors of the Japanese Society of Endourology belong, 42 (28%) have carried out laparoendoscopic single‐site and reduced port surgery. A total of 32 of these institutions agreed to participate in this survey. Patients who had undergone surgery between January 2008 and March 2014 were included in the present study. Results: Overall, 1145 cases of laparoendoscopic single‐site and reduced port surgery were recorded during the study period. The most frequent procedures were adrenalectomy and radical nephrectomy. Laparoendoscopic single‐site and reduced port surgery represented 12% (872/7311) of all laparoscopic procedures carried out at participating institutions. The number of patients who underwent pyeloplasty, donor nephrectomy and simple nephrectomy tended to increase, whereas those who underwent adrenalectomy, radical nephrectomy and nephroureterectomy peaked in 2012, and then tended to decrease in 2013. The rates of conversion, perioperative and postoperative complications, were 2.7%, 2.2% and 4.5%, respectively. Conclusions: The number of laparoendoscopic single‐site and reduced port urological surgeries in Japan has increased for benign indications, such as pyeloplasty, donor nephrectomy and simple nephrectomy. In contrast, procedures such as adrenalectomy and radical nephrectomy are trending down after reaching a peak in 2012.

Levin's book, Ameritopia: The Unmaking of America, you will discover how America's government has been slowly descending into tyranny using utopian tactics that serve to bring citizens under control until they are completely dependent upon the state for sustenance.The evidence for Levin's claims is presented in an engaging format beginning with the definition of utopia and ending with specific examples of how America has become a utopian state. Levin takes you back in history to show you other examples of utopia and how all of them eventually descended into tyranny. He also talks about what makes America unique and how the Founding Fathers intended the government to operate. Levin points out time and time again that the current governmental atmosphere is far from the original intentions, which were based on the philosophies of John Locke and Charles de Montesquieu. Instead, Levin suggests the country is trending toward the ideal societies imagined by Plato, Thomas More, Thomas Hobbes ad even Karl Marx. However, Levin proves that these societies were anything but ideal by digging deeper into their power-hungry intentions and oppressive practices. Using more evidence from Constitution, Levin expertly contrasts today's American society with the Founding Fathers' purposeful inclusions and exclusions, and then compares it to utopian ideals to illustrate how far from the Founders' original vision America has strayed.\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1495963918'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781495963919'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 40, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Political Science'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=6oWIoAEACAAJ&dq=current+trending+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Methods of measuring scholarly influence can be highly controversial, but the authors of this work clearly outline their methodology, developed over years of experience working with this area of study. Through their expertise in Criminology and Criminal Justice, they are able to solve problems that affect or confound many traditional forms of citation analysis, such as irregularly cited references or self-citations. It includes 25 years of data (1986 through 2010) on the most-cited scholars and works in major American and international Criminology and Criminal Justice journals, and provides an objective measure of influence and prestige. Through an analysis of the data, the authors also document the intellectual development of criminology and criminal justice as a field of study since 1986. They highlight the development of research trends and indicate areas for future research. This book is designed for use by scholars and academics in the fields of Criminology and Criminal Justice, and the methodology will be of interest to researchers in related disciplines, including Sociology and Social Psychology. -- Cohn, Farrington, and Iratzoqui provide an invaluable service in unpacking the criminological enterprise. Using systematic citational analysis, they illuminate the core patterns of scholarly influence that have shaped the field’s development. This volume is an essential resource for all those wishing to understand which scholars and writings have done most—within and across time periods—to affect thinking about crime and justice. Francis T. Cullen Distinguished Research Professor University of Cincinnati - Citation analyses have become one of the most significant measures of scholarly influence. They are especially useful for revealing major trends over time regarding authors and the topics of interest to the wider field. Cohn, Farrington, and Iratzoqui's Most Cited Scholars in Criminology and Criminal Justice, 1986-2010 provides the most up-to-date, comprehensive, and longitudinal investigation of scholarly influence in criminology/criminal justice. This resource is a most interesting read, one that supplies not a mere counting of citations but clear ideas about where the field has been centered and where it is trending into the future. Alex R.

Obesity, cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer\\'s, ADHD in children, and so many other ailments are plaguing humanity today. To counter the ill effects of the present age, a variety of diets are in vogue. This book is going to take an in-depth look at a trending new age diet - The Paleo Diet. The Paleo Diet is believed to be the diet followed by our ancestors in the Stone Age. It primarily consists of meat, fish, fruits, berries, and tubers, sans the dairy products, cereals and the processed food. It was Dr. Boyd Eaton\\'s paper \"Paleolithic Nutrition: A Consideration of its Nature and Current Implications\" that brought to the fore the health implications of this caveman diet to modern society. I have referred to stalwarts like Dr. Loren Cordain, who has contributed significantly in the field of evolution and diet. This book will attempt to give you an understanding of following a food plan that ensures that your body is not ingesting and digesting food that is laden with carcinogenic additives and preservatives. This book attempts to provide a brief introduction to Paleo diet before plunging into the strengths of the various Paleo ingredients. In the course of the book you will be surprised to find that several delectable dishes can be made from Paleo ingredients. I will also briefly touch on how exercise and Paleo diet can go hand in hand and how muscle building is so possible when following this caveman diet. Hopefully, on this journey you can become an ardent Paleo follower and progress towards a fitter, healthier and happier you.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1533585318'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781533585318'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 32, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': None, 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=dHaKDAEACAAJ&dq=current+trending+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

We previously introduced a novel algorithm to calculate the Compensatory Reserve Index (CRI) based on the analysis of arterial waveform features obtained from photoplethysmogram recordings. In the present study, we hypothesized that the CRI would provide greater sensitivity and specificity to detect blood loss compared with traditional vital signs and other hemodynamic measures. Continuous noninvasive vital sign waveform data, including CRI, photoplethysmogram, heart rate, blood pressures, SpO2, cardiac output, and stroke volume, were analyzed from 20 subjects before, during, and after an average controlled voluntary hemorrhage of ∼1.2 L of blood. Compensatory Reserve Index decreased by 33% in a linear fashion across progressive blood volume loss, with no clinically significant alterations in vital signs. The receiver operating characteristic area under the curve for the CRI was 0.90, with a sensitivity of 0.80 and specificity of 0.76. In comparison, blood pressures, heart rate, SpO2, cardiac output, and stroke volume had significantly lower receiver operating characteristic area under the curve values and specificities for detecting the same volume of blood loss. Consistent with our hypothesis, CRI detected blood loss and restoration with significantly greater specificity than did other traditional physiologic measures. Single measurement of CRI may enable more accurate triage, whereas CRI monitoring may allow for earlier detection of casualty deterioration.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'OTHER', 'identifier': 'OCLC:1051788865'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': None, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': None, 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=E2vwvQEACAAJ&dq=current+trending+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

This study explored the viability of price-trending strategy. The weak form of Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) precludes any consistent profitable application of trading rules based on price trends. By back-testing variations of Moving Average method and modified Filter rule using the daily historical prices from 2000-2009 of six PSE Index members, this paper gathered empirical data on the financial returns, net of transaction costs, generated by these Technical rules and compared them to the Buy-and Hold's returns to evaluate profitability. To validate the findings, the results were subjected to one-factor ANOVA and t-Tests at 5% significance level. The paper's descriptive-correlation approach yielded results indicating support for the viability to Technical Analysis in the Philippine stock market, thus, implying the invalidity of EMH's weak form. All five Filter variants of the seven technical rules bakc-tested have consistently outperformed the Buy-and-Hold's net returns in all six stocks. The Moving Average variants, however, performed better only in four of the samples. Single-factor ANOVA of net returns resulted to no significant difference among the strategies while the t-Tests between mean excess returns and mean transaction costs indicated that, excepts for one stock, the excess returns of the technical variants over Buy-and-Hold are significants greater tha the costs - thus, implying significants excess returns above Buy-and-Hold. Finding weak-form inefficiency in the Philippine market through limited samples and narrow technical parameters, investors and academics should explore broader sample and more extensive parameters and methods to determine the extent of variable application of technical analysis as alternative investment strategy.\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'OTHER', 'identifier': 'OCLC:989372653'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 118, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': None, 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=CcEPtAEACAAJ&dq=current+trending+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

James Harrington', 'Brett Trusko'], 'publisher': 'CRC Press', 'publishedDate': '2014-04-08', 'description': 'Value proposition, an old concept, is taking on new significance in today’s innovation-driven environment. Business focus has shifted from developing many creative ideas to developing only those that will successfully flow through the product cycle and fulfill a customer need. The old approach resulted in less than a 10 percent success rate for concepts that started through the product cycle; this can no longer be tolerated. This new book on value propositions outlines a systematic approach to making an early evaluation of potential projects and programs so you can determine if they can add real value to your organization or its customers—potentially saving you millions of dollars and months of valuable time. Focusing on the necessary data collection efforts, Maximizing Value Propositions to Increase Project Success Rates will help you identify easy opportunities for improvement and will guide you through the process of creating value propositions for the ideas that will drive the organization’s future profits. It outlines a four-stage approach to creating value propositions and explains how to create effective value proposition documents. The book illustrates the role of the opportunity center in capturing new ideas, describes how to present value propositions to management, and includes an example of a new product value proposition. Detailing a method for continuous review of the improvement process, it will help you foster an entrepreneurial mind-set within your employees and encourage them to actively search and document value-adding ideas. Through the effective use of value propositions it is completely possible for your organization to increase the number of new products/services it offers to your customers by over 100 percent. It is not unusual for this to result in more than a 40 percent increase in profits per year. Adopting the approach outlined in the text for using value propositions can save your organizations millions of dollars and much time.

PSD-95 deficiency has been linked to cognitive and learning deficits implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. In previous studies shown within the hippocampus, PSD-95 deficiency causes a significant reduction in the excitatory response at the postsynaptic membrane. However, little is known whether PSD-95 deficiency will affect gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic inhibitory synapses in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Using a PSD-95 transgenic mouse model (PSD-95 +/-), we study how PSD-95 deficiency affects GABAA receptor expression and function in the mPFC of adolescent mice. Using Western blot, we show a significant decrease in protein expression levels of PSD-95 in the PSD-95 +/- mouse, confirming sufficient reduction of the protein. Our results also show a significant increase in the GABAA receptor subunit [alpha]1 and a trending increase in the subunits [alpha]2. We utilized whole-cell patch clamp to record spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) as a measure of GABA-mediated current in layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the mPFC. We found significant increases in sIPSC frequency and amplitude in PSD-95+/- mice. In addition, we show a decrease of evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs) and a significant increase in evoked IPSCs (eIPSCs), leading to a significant decrease in the excitatory-to-inhibitory balance in PSD-95+/- mice. Our study suggests that PSD-95 deficiency causes an increase in the inhibitory response in the mPFC due to an increase in GABA receptor presence and function, consequently leading to a shift in the excitatory/inhibitory balance. This study will provide novel insights into the importance of GABAergic transmission in the mPFC in response to PSD-95 deficiency and its potential link with cognitive and learning deficits associated with autism and schizophrenia.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'OTHER', 'identifier': 'OCLC:1076547523'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 54, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['GABA'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=vpvovgEACAAJ&dq=current+trending+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

      "item info :  {'title': 'Plio-Pleistocene evolution of the upper continental slope, Garden Banks and East Breaks areas, Northwestern Gulf of Mexico', 'subtitle': None, 'authors': ['Joseph Carl Fiduk'], 'publisher': None, 'publishedDate': '1994', 'description': 'Over 7000 sq. km of salt and six Plio-Pleistocene biostratigraphic horizons were mapped in the East Breaks and Garden Banks areas using a 12,000 km grid of seismic data and all obtainable well data. Structure mapping of allochthonous Jurassic salt and the six horizons (Globoquadrina altispira, Lenticulina 1, Angulogerina B, Hyalinea B, Trimosina A, and Sangamon Fauna) and isopachs of the intervals between these horizons revealed notable lateral variations in the area underlain by salt, in the degree of salt deformation, and in the size and thickness of associated intraslope basins. East of 94.5° W salt structures occupy 40% of the area and exhibit complex shapes that suggest a high degree of salt deformation. West of 94.5° W salt structures occupy 11% of the area and consist mostly of structurally simple salt stocks. A zone of high-offset north-south trending faults mark the transition between these two areas. Isopach maps of the six Plio-Pleistocene intervals (from 2.9 Ma to the present) reveal major shifts in the rates and locations of sediment accumulation. From 2.9 to 1.0 Ma. sediment-accumulation rates averaged only 0.8-1.3 mm/y with a maximum rate of 2.7 mm/y. From 1.0 to 0.69 Ma. sediment-accumulation rates averaged 5.8 mm/y with a maximum rate of 11.6 mm/y. This interval correlates to sediments deposited between the extinctions of Hyalinea balthica and Trimosina denticulata and recorded a major period of sediment loading/salt withdrawal between 1.0-0.69 Ma. From the end of this time to the present, sediment -accumulation rates averaged 1.7-2.1 mm/y with a maximum rate measured at 6.2 mm/y. Increased sediment influx during 1.0-0.69 Ma coincides with a major third order sea level lowstand and was focused in central Garden Banks. The restriction of such dramatically increased accumulation rates to this area suggests that sediment influx was accompanied by large-scale salt withdrawal. The increase in accommodation space created by salt withdrawal appears to be the most important factor affecting accumulation rates. Salt structural styles found on the upper continental slope are transitional between those found on the lower slope and those on the shelf. The shelf is dominated by isolated, individual salt stocks (km2) surrounded by kilometer thick sedimentary sections. The lower slope is dominated by broad, laterally continuous, allochthonous salt sheets (103 km2) with moderate to thin sediment cover. The upper slope contains both of these structural styles plus intermediate size (10-102 km2) salt ridges and massifs. Observations made during this study suggest that differential sediment loading is the mechanism causing the changes in structural style. A Loading/Dissection model is presented to explain the formation of the three primary salt structural styles, their genetic relationship, and their observed distribution. Differential loading has dissected large salt sheets into numerous smaller and irregularly shaped ridges and stocks (like those found on the upper slope). Salt found on the upper slope originated in the Jurassic Louann Formation, but is now surrounded by Pleistocene age sediments. To achieve this relationship, it appears that some Jurassic salt has undergone at least two cycles of sediment loading and consequent diapirism. Salt/sediment relationships suggest that virtually all of the mapped salt is allochthonous. Repetitive sediment loading and salt structural development has not been previously documented and represents a step beyond the limits of current salt structural models.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'OTHER', 'identifier': 'OCLC:31373553'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 622, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Continental slopes'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=4h_cxgEACAAJ&dq=current+trending+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

DeBoer'], 'publisher': None, 'publishedDate': '2009', 'description': 'Turnagain Arm is the hypertidal (commonly exceeding 9 m) west-east trending extension of Cook Inlet in south-central Alaska. The inlet formed from a drowned glacial valley that was subsequently filled with tidal deposits of silt and fine sand. The tidal system is semidiurnal with a prominent diurnal inequality. There are also variations due to spring and neap tides. Turnagain Arm is home to a tidal bore generated during spring tides that can reach heights of up to 2 m and travel at speeds of up to 5 m/s. Current reversals can be dramatic with ebb tidal velocities of 6 m/s changing to flood velocities of 10 m/s over a period of a few minutes. During the initial flood tide, highly turbid water can rise as fast as 10 cm/min. This combination of elements results in a highly dynamic depositional setting. Measurements taken in the inner estuary during several neap-spring cycles in the summers of 2007-08 documented deposition upon mud bars of as much as 8.9 cm per tidal event. Conversely, erosion of up to 13.5 cm per tidal event has been measured. The highest rates of deposition and erosion occurred during the spring tides while much lower rates occur during the neap tides. Some portions of the inner estuary are only submerged during the extreme high tides. The magnitude of the high tide needed to cover each site increases with increasing distance into the upper estuary. Even if submerged, deposition does not always occur. Such a high percentage of non-depositional events has real implications when interpreting tidal cyclicity of the rhythmites found at these sites.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'OTHER', 'identifier': 'OCLC:355149790'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': None, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': None, 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=R4PnjwEACAAJ&dq=current+trending+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Due to its location between the seismically active Wabash Valley, Saint Genevieve, and the New Madrid Seismic Zones, and the prevalence of nearby structural features, this fault system merits its own systematic study. Using existing data from the EarthScope Transportable Array, seismic activity and implications for hazard are explored through microseismicity. Over a two-year period, the closest two seismometers to the CGFS were utilized to search for microseismicity along the fault. Analysis was done through visually assessing waveforms and frequency-amplitude plots, which can help differentiate mine blasts and earthquakes based on the frequency content of the waveform. During the 2-year deployment, a total of 94 seismic events were detected, with 5 previously unrecorded earthquakes located within the Cottage Grove Seismic Zone, although none were located on the main fault. The greatest magnitude of the Cottage Grove Fault System events found was an ML 1.5 and the smallest an ML 0.8. The methodology found all seismic events mb 2.3 or greater listed by the Center for Earthquake Research and Information (CERI) catalog, within a 150 km radius. Missed events from the CERI catalog were small and distant. Finding earthquakes near the Cottage Grove Fault System undetected by the CERI network demonstrates that the region has a degree of previously undetected seismic activity. Preliminary event detection is better explained by a b-value of 0.7 than a b-value of 1.0, suggesting current estimates of the hazard of the CGFS is underestimated.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'OTHER', 'identifier': 'OCLC:1078436498'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 182, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Earthquake hazard analysis'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=yyNxwAEACAAJ&dq=current+trending+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

However, the A1c assay is plagued with significant noise, lag time, and specificity issues. Current studies support the significant health care advantage of clinical action based on real-time blood glucose (BG) metrics. We seek to improve diabetes management by directly relating such metrics to AG levels as mediated by recently discovered recurrent endocrine cycles. Methods: Several studies collected multiple months of BG data on 111 subjects totaling 261 893 CGM measurements and 29 278 meter readings. These data are a rich source of multiday metrics in terms of the CGM and SMBG daily profiles. The recurrent endocrine patterns expose key metric relationships for monitoring AG related to A1c using CGM and SMBG data. Consequently, day-to-day tracking of AG is expressed as a simple two-parameter function of fasting BG for all studies. Results: Consequently, when applied to 2518 qualified days of 64 subjects, the function predicts daily AG values with 2% relative standard error. All studies produced compatible results. By restricting one parameter to a constant, the error increased to 3%. Conclusions: The recurrent endocrine patterns revealed a persistent structure hidden within the multiday fluctuations that becomes a simple meter-compatible equation that accurately measures real-time trending of AG using fasting BG values. This enables a digital health monitoring service and self-monitoring device that reveals immediate disease progression as well as the impact of interventions and medications better than possible with the A1c assay.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'OTHER', 'identifier': 'OCLC:1051928413'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': None, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': None, 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=rHHTvQEACAAJ&dq=current+trending+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

PM has been studied extensively in clinical populations in which these cognitive processes are impaired but has only recently been studied in Huntingtons disease (HD), a neurodegenerative disease of the basal ganglia that is associated with neuropsychiatric, movement, and cognitive changes. The purpose of the present study was to further examine PM in HD, as well as investigate the influence of impulsivity on PM performance and whether a monetary incentive (either reward or loss) would improve PM performance. Results of the current study indicated that overall individuals with HD performed worse on a PM task compared to Controls. Control participants evidenced significantly better PM performance when they could have potentially lost money compared to a Neutral PM task. HD participants demonstrated a similar pattern of findings at a trending significance level. Impulsivity, as measured by the total score on the BIS-11, was not related to PM performance in either group. Controls scored significantly higher on a self-reported measure of prospective and retrospective memory (PRMQ) relative to HD participants with a trending association between the PRMQ and PM performance in Controls, but no association in HD participants. While there was a significant difference between groups on a recognition test of PM cues, there was no difference between groups on a free recall test of PM task instructions. These results build upon previous research that has found PM deficits in HD by investigating possible factors that may improve PM performance in this clinical population. Future research should investigate other motivational factors that may further increase PM performance in HD.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'OTHER', 'identifier': 'OCLC:1102484992'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 83, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': [\"Huntington's disease\"], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=fVy5xQEACAAJ&dq=current+trending+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

One scandalous proposition. Endless possibilities... *** Seconds stretch into forever as I continue to wait on his doorstep, time seeming to slow down to a glacial pace. Eventually, I hear footsteps. And they get progressively louder with each passing second. Someone’s approaching. It’s him. I swallow against the avalanche of anxiety piling in my throat, clutching the handles of my duffel bag until my palms sting like hell. I\\'m probably making the bruising from my fall a lot worse, but I can\\'t stop. And then I hear it. The metallic sound of a turning lock. And then another. And one more. Oh, my God, this is it... *** Feast your eyeballs and fall absolutely head over heels in love with Eme Strife\\'s edgy, sizzling, intriguing, incredibly sexy, and captivating unconventional romance story. Each installment will keep you strapped to the very edge of your seat and constantly guessing on one hell of an emotional roller-coaster. You\\'ll never think of the phrase, \"Doctor-Patient Confidentiality” in the same way ever again once you read this! This story unfolds over several volumes. IT IS NOT A STANDALONE. This is the eighth book. Rated 18+ This series contains mature and adult content (nudity, graphic sex, and strong language). Because of its explicit nature, it is intended for mature audiences only.

      "item info :  {'title': 'Doctor-Patient Confidentiality: Volume Seven (Confidential #1)', 'authors': ['Eme Strife'], 'publisher': '(Eme)nded Publishing', 'publishedDate': '2015-12-30', 'description': 'Two very different people. One scandalous proposition. Endless possibilities... *** My body jerks upright, lunging itself out of my fetal position as if I’ve just been electrocuted by a dozen angry eels. My eyes dart to the closed drawer, bulging wide open as a blended rush of surprise, anxiety, and perhaps a teeny tiny bit of excitement force my heart to pick up its pace. A hefty dose of adrenaline instantly floods my system, and all traces of tiredness and fatigue instantly disappear. I extend my arm without thinking, my body moving on impulse, but my hand freezes as soon as it comes into contact with the drawer, my fingers going stiff and rigid as soon as they wrap themselves around the small knob. After several more seconds and rapid, shallow breaths, I finally bring myself to pull it open, and when my fingers find the outline of the unmistakable hard, thin plastic device, my heart pumps so fast that I think it just might bruise itself from the exertion. I grab it from under the clutter of papers and random items, almost dropping it in my nervous klutziness. And then I see it, displayed boldly across the sleek touchscreen. A text message. From him. *** Feast your eyeballs and fall absolutely head over heels in love with Eme Strife\\'s edgy, sizzling, intriguing, incredibly sexy, and captivating unconventional romance story. Each installment will keep you strapped to the very edge of your seat and constantly guessing on one hell of an emotional roller-coaster. You\\'ll never think of the phrase, \"Doctor-Patient Confidentiality”, in the same way ever again once you read this! This story unfolds over several volumes. IT IS NOT A STANDALONE. This is the seventh book. Rated 18+ This series contains mature and adult content (nudity, graphic sex, and strong language). Because of its explicit nature, it is intended for mature audiences only.

So in late 1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. But Kya is not what they say. Sensitive and intelligent, she has survived for years alone in the marsh that she calls home, finding friends in the gulls and lessons in the sand. Then the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. When two young men from town become intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new life--until the unthinkable happens. Perfect for fans of Barbara Kingsolver and Karen Russell, Where the Crawdads Sing is at once an exquisite ode to the natural world, a heartbreaking coming-of-age story, and a surprising tale of possible murder.

Archer and Jockers just may have done so.\"—Sylvia Day, New York Times bestselling author Ask most people about massive success in the world of fiction, and you’ll typically hear that it’s a game of hazy crystal balls. The sales figures of E. L. James or Dan Brown seem to be freakish—random occurrences in an unknowable market. But what if there were an algorithm that could reveal a secret DNA of bestsellers, regardless of their genre? What if it knew, just from analyzing the words alone, not just why genre writers like John Grisham and Danielle Steel belong on the lists, but also that authors such as Junot Diaz, Jodi Picoult, and Donna Tartt had telltale signs of success all over their pages? Thanks to Jodie Archer and Matthew Jockers, the algorithm exists, the code has been cracked, and the results bring fresh new insights into how fiction works and why we read. The Bestseller Code offers a new theory for why Fifty Shades of Grey sold so well. It sheds light on the current craze for dark heroines. It reveals which themes tend to sell best. And all with fascinating supporting data taken from a five-year study of twenty thousand novels. Then there is the hunt for \"the one\"—the paradigmatic example of bestselling writing according to a computer\\'s analysis of thousands of points of data. The result is surprising, a bit ironic, and delightfully unorthodox. This book explains groundbreaking text-mining research in accessible terms and offers a new perspective on the New York Times bestseller list. It\\'s a big-idea book about the relationship between creativity and technology that will be provocative to anyone interested in how analytics have already transformed the worlds of finance, medicine, and sports. But at heart it is a celebration of books for readers and writers—a compelling investigation into how successful writing works, and a fresh take on our intellectual and emotional response to stories.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781250088284'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1250088283'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 320, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Language Arts & Disciplines'], 'averageRating': 3.0, 'ratingsCount': 3, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=F4JzCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Named a Most Anticipated Book of 2019 by Oprah.com, Real Simple, Buzzfeed, Cosmopolitan, GoodReads, PureWow, Vulture, The Millions and more. \"Life is both fleeting and dangerous, and there is no point in denying yourself pleasure, or being anything other than what you are.\" Beloved author Elizabeth Gilbert returns to fiction with a unique love story set in the New York City theater world during the 1940s. Told from the perspective of an older woman as she looks back on her youth with both pleasure and regret (but mostly pleasure), City of Girls explores themes of female sexuality and promiscuity, as well as the idiosyncrasies of true love. In 1940, nineteen-year-old Vivian Morris has just been kicked out of Vassar College, owing to her lackluster freshman-year performance. Her affluent parents send her to Manhattan to live with her Aunt Peg, who owns a flamboyant, crumbling midtown theater called the Lily Playhouse. There Vivian is introduced to an entire cosmos of unconventional and charismatic characters, from the fun-chasing showgirls to a sexy male actor, a grand-dame actress, a lady-killer writer, and no-nonsense stage manager. But when Vivian makes a personal mistake that results in professional scandal, it turns her new world upside down in ways that it will take her years to fully understand. Ultimately, though, it leads her to a new understanding of the kind of life she craves - and the kind of freedom it takes to pursue it. It will also lead to the love of her life, a love that stands out from all the rest. Now eighty-nine years old and telling her story at last, Vivian recalls how the events of those years altered the course of her life - and the gusto and autonomy with which she approached it. \"At some point in a woman\\'s life, she just gets tired of being ashamed all the time,\" she muses. \"After that, she is free to become whoever she truly is.\" Written with a powerful wisdom about human desire and connection, City of Girls is a love story like no other.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780698408326'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0698408322'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 480, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Fiction'], 'averageRating': 3.5, 'ratingsCount': 6, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MOFwDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

As the Civil Rights movement begins to reach the black enclave of Frenchtown in segregated Tallahassee, Elwood Curtis takes the words of Dr. Martin Luther King to heart: He is \"as good as anyone.\" Abandoned by his parents, but kept on the straight and narrow by his grandmother, Elwood is about to enroll in the local black college. But for a black boy in the Jim Crow South of the early 1960s, one innocent mistake is enough to destroy the future. Elwood is sentenced to a juvenile reformatory called the Nickel Academy, whose mission statement says it provides \"physical, intellectual and moral training\" so the delinquent boys in their charge can become \"honorable and honest men.\" In reality, the Nickel Academy is a grotesque chamber of horrors where the sadistic staff beats and sexually abuses the students, corrupt officials and locals steal food and supplies, and any boy who resists is likely to disappear \"out back.\" Stunned to find himself in such a vicious environment, Elwood tries to hold onto Dr. King\\'s ringing assertion \"Throw us in jail and we will still love you.\" His friend Turner thinks Elwood is worse than naive, that the world is crooked, and that the only way to survive is to scheme and avoid trouble. The tension between Elwood\\'s ideals and Turner\\'s skepticism leads to a decision whose repercussions will echo down the decades. Formed in the crucible of the evils Jim Crow wrought, the boys\\' fates will be determined by what they endured at the Nickel Academy. Based on the real story of a reform school in Florida that operated for one hundred and eleven years and warped the lives of thousands of children, The Nickel Boys is a devastating, driven narrative that showcases a great American novelist writing at the height of his powers.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780385537087'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0385537085'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 224, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Fiction'], 'averageRating': 4.5, 'ratingsCount': 9, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aDdyDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

It thrills us and torments us. It controls our thoughts, destroys our lives, and it’s all we live for. Yet we almost never speak of it. And as a buried force in our lives, desire remains largely unexplored—until now. Over the past eight years, journalist Lisa Taddeo has driven across the country six times to embed herself with ordinary women from different regions and backgrounds. The result, Three Women, is the deepest nonfiction portrait of desire ever written and one of the most anticipated books of the year. We begin in suburban Indiana with Lina, a homemaker and mother of two whose marriage, after a decade, has lost its passion. She passes her days cooking and cleaning for a man who refuses to kiss her on the mouth, protesting that “the sensation offends” him. To Lina’s horror, even her marriage counselor says her husband’s position is valid. Starved for affection, Lina battles daily panic attacks. When she reconnects with an old flame through social media, she embarks on an affair that quickly becomes all-consuming. In North Dakota we meet Maggie, a seventeen-year-old high school student who finds a confidant in her handsome, married English teacher. By Maggie’s account, supportive nightly texts and phone calls evolve into a clandestine physical relationship, with plans to skip school on her eighteenth birthday and make love all day; instead, he breaks up with her on the morning he turns thirty. A few years later, Maggie has no degree, no career, and no dreams to live for. When she learns that this man has been named North Dakota’s Teacher of the Year, she steps forward with her story—and is met with disbelief by former schoolmates and the jury that hears her case. The trial will turn their quiet community upside down. Finally, in an exclusive enclave of the Northeast, we meet Sloane—a gorgeous, successful, and refined restaurant owner—who is happily married to a man who likes to watch her have sex with other men and women. He picks out partners for her alone or for a threesome, and she ensures that everyone’s needs are satisfied. For years, Sloane has been asking herself where her husband’s desire ends and hers begins. One day, they invite a new man into their bed—but he brings a secret with him that will finally force Sloane to confront the uneven power dynamics that fuel their lifestyle. Based on years of immersive reporting, and told with astonishing frankness and immediacy, Three Women is a groundbreaking portrait of erotic longing in today’s America, exposing the fragility, complexity, and inequality of female desire with unprecedented depth and emotional power. It is both a feat of journalism and a triumph of storytelling, brimming with nuance and empathy, that introduces us to three unforgettable women—and one remarkable writer—whose experiences remind us that we are not alone.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781451642292'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1451642296'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 320, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['History'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=LNecDwAAQBAJ&dq=current+bestseller+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

McCabe'], 'publisher': \"St. Martin's Press\", 'publishedDate': '2019-02-19', 'description': '#1 New York Times Bestseller #1 Washington Post Bestseller #1 Wall Street Journal Bestseller On March 16, 2018, just twenty-six hours before his scheduled retirement from the organization he had served with distinction for more than two decades, Andrew G. McCabe was fired from his position as deputy director of the FBI. President Donald Trump celebrated on Twitter: \"Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy.\" In The Threat: How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump, Andrew G. McCabe offers a dramatic and candid account of his career, and an impassioned defense of the FBI\\'s agents, and of the institution\\'s integrity and independence in protecting America and upholding our Constitution. McCabe started as a street agent in the FBI\\'s New York field office, serving under director Louis Freeh. He became an expert in two kinds of investigations that are critical to American national security: Russian organized crime—which is inextricably linked to the Russian state—and terrorism. Under Director Robert Mueller, McCabe led the investigations of major attacks on American soil, including the Boston Marathon bombing, a plot to bomb the New York subways, and several narrowly averted bombings of aircraft. And under James Comey, McCabe was deeply involved in the controversial investigations of the Benghazi attack, the Clinton Foundation\\'s activities, and Hillary Clinton\\'s use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. The Threat recounts in compelling detail the time between Donald Trump\\'s November 2016 election and McCabe\\'s firing, set against a page-turning narrative spanning two decades when the FBI\\'s mission shifted to a new goal: preventing terrorist attacks on Americans. But as McCabe shows, right now the greatest threat to the United States comes from within, as President Trump and his administration ignore the law, attack democratic institutions, degrade human rights, and undermine the U.S. Constitution that protects every citizen. Important, revealing, and powerfully argued, The Threat tells the true story of what the FBI is, how it works, and why it will endure as an institution of integrity that protects America.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781250207593'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1250207592'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 288, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Biography & Autobiography'], 'averageRating': 4.0, 'ratingsCount': 7, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=F7tuDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Then one cool October morning he rose early, drove into town, and committed a shocking crime. Pete\\'s only statement about it--to the sheriff, to his lawyers, to the judge, to the jury, and to his family--was: \"I have nothing to say.\" He was not afraid of death and was willing to take his motive to the grave. In a major novel unlike anything he has written before, John Grisham takes us on an incredible journey, from the Jim Crow South to the jungles of the Philippines during World War II; from an insane asylum filled with secrets to the Clanton courtroom where Pete\\'s defense attorney tries desperately to save him.

Now you see her. Now you don’t. THE NEW GIRL. A new thriller of deception, betrayal, and vengeance. She was covered from head to toe in expensive wool and plaid, the sort of stuff one saw at the Burberry boutique in Harrods. She carried a leather bookbag rather than a nylon backpack. Her patent leather ballet slippers were glossy and bright. She was proper, the new girl, modest. But there was something else about her … At an exclusive private school in Switzerland, mystery surrounds the identity of the beautiful raven-haired girl who arrives each morning in a motorcade fit for a head of state. She is said to be the daughter of a wealthy international businessman. In truth, her father is Khalid bin Mohammed, the much-maligned crown prince of Saudi Arabia. Once celebrated for his daring social and religious reforms, he is now reviled for his role in the murder of a dissident journalist. And when his only child is brutally kidnapped, he turns to the one man he can trust to find her before it is too late. What’s done cannot be undone … Gabriel Allon, the legendary chief of Israeli intelligence, has spent most of his life fighting terrorists, including the murderous jihadists financed by Saudi Arabia. Prince Khalid—or KBM, as he is known—has pledged to finally break the bond between the Kingdom and radical Islam. For that reason alone, Gabriel regards him as a valuable if flawed partner. Together they will become unlikely allies in a deadly secret war for control of the Middle East. The life of a child, and the throne of Saudi Arabia, hang in the balance. Both men have made their share of enemies. And both have everything to lose. Filled with dark humor, breathtaking twists of plot, and an unforgettable cast of characters, The New Girl is both a thrilling, page-turning tale of entertainment and a sophisticated study of political alliances and great-power rivalries in a dangerous world. And it is once again proof that Gabriel Allon is “one of fiction’s greatest spies” (Kirkus) and Daniel Silva is “quite simply the best” (Kansas City Star) writer of foreign intrigue and suspense at work today.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780062834898'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0062834894'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 496, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Fiction'], 'averageRating': 5.0, 'ratingsCount': 1, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6GdzDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Mrs. Everything is an ambitious, richly textured journey through history—and herstory—as these two sisters navigate a changing America over the course of their lives. Do we change or does the world change us? Jo and Bethie Kaufman were born into a world full of promise. Growing up in 1950s Detroit, they live in a perfect “Dick and Jane” house, where their roles in the family are clearly defined. Jo is the tomboy, the bookish rebel with a passion to make the world more fair; Bethie is the pretty, feminine good girl, a would-be star who enjoys the power her beauty confers and dreams of a traditional life. But the truth ends up looking different from what the girls imagined. Jo and Bethie survive traumas and tragedies. As their lives unfold against the background of free love and Vietnam, Woodstock and women’s lib, Bethie becomes an adventure-loving wild child who dives headlong into the counterculture and is up for anything (except settling down). Meanwhile, Jo becomes a proper young mother in Connecticut, a witness to the changing world instead of a participant. Neither woman inhabits the world she dreams of, nor has a life that feels authentic or brings her joy. Is it too late for the women to finally stake a claim on happily ever after?

As part of the Treaty of Paris, in which Great Britain recognized the new United States of America, Britain ceded the land that comprised the immense Northwest Territory, a wilderness empire northwest of the Ohio River containing the future states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. A Massachusetts minister named Manasseh Cutler was instrumental in opening this vast territory to veterans of the Revolutionary War and their families for settlement. Included in the Northwest Ordinance were three remarkable conditions: freedom of religion, free universal education, and most importantly, the prohibition of slavery. In 1788 the first band of pioneers set out from New England for the Northwest Territory under the leadership of Revolutionary War veteran General Rufus Putnam. They settled in what is now Marietta on the banks of the Ohio River. McCullough tells the story through five major characters: Cutler and Putnam; Cutler’s son Ephraim; and two other men, one a carpenter turned architect, and the other a physician who became a prominent pioneer in American science. They and their families created a town in a primeval wilderness, while coping with such frontier realities as floods, fires, wolves and bears, no roads or bridges, no guarantees of any sort, all the while negotiating a contentious and sometimes hostile relationship with the native people. Like so many of McCullough’s subjects, they let no obstacle deter or defeat them. Drawn in great part from a rare and all-but-unknown collection of diaries and letters by the key figures, The Pioneers is a uniquely American story of people whose ambition and courage led them to remarkable accomplishments. This is a revelatory and quintessentially American story, written with David McCullough’s signature narrative energy.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781501168680'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1501168681'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 352, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['History'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=fI2RDwAAQBAJ&dq=current+bestseller+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Since Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States, the country—and the world—has witnessed a stormy, outrageous, and absolutely mesmerizing presidential term that reflects the volatility and fierceness of the man elected Commander-in-Chief. This riveting and explosive account of Trump’s administration provides a wealth of new details about the chaos in the Oval Office, including: -- What President Trump’s staff really thinks of him -- What inspired Trump to claim he was wire-tapped by President Obama -- Why FBI director James Comey was really fired -- Why chief strategist Steve Bannon and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner couldn’t be in the same room -- Who is really directing the Trump administration’s strategy in the wake of Bannon’s firing -- What the secret to communicating with Trump is -- What the Trump administration has in common with the movie The Producers Never before in history has a presidency so divided the American people.

Comedy legends and A-list actors. Supermodels and centerfolds. Moguls and mobsters. A president. Over his unrivaled four-decade career in radio, Howard Stern has interviewed thousands of personalities—discussing sex, relationships, money, fame, spirituality, and success with the boldest of bold-faced names. But which interviews are his favorites? It’s one of the questions he gets asked most frequently. Howard Stern Comes Again delivers his answer. This book is a feast of conversation and more, as between the lines Stern offers his definitive autobiography—a magnum opus of confession and personal exploration. Tracy Morgan opens up about his near-fatal car crash. Lady Gaga divulges her history with cocaine. Madonna reminisces on her relationship with Tupac Shakur. Bill Murray waxes philosophical on the purpose of life. Jerry Seinfeld offers a master class on comedy. Harvey Weinstein denies the existence of the so-called casting couch. An impressive array of creative visionaries weigh in on what Stern calls “the climb”—the stories of how they struggled and eventually prevailed. As he writes in the introduction, “If you’re having trouble finding motivation in life and you’re looking for that extra kick in the ass, you will find it in these pages.” Interspersed throughout are rare selections from the Howard Stern Show archives with Donald Trump that depict his own climb: transforming from Manhattan tabloid fixture to reality TV star to president of the United States. Stern also tells of his Moby Dick-like quest to land an interview with Hillary Clinton in the run-up to the 2016 election—one of many newly written revelations from the author. He speaks with extraordinary candor about a variety of subjects, including his overwhelming insecurity early in his career, his revolutionary move from terrestrial radio to SiriusXM, and his belief in the power of psychotherapy. As Stern insightfully notes in the introduction: “The interviews collected here represent my best work and show my personal evolution. But they don’t just show my evolution.

Justice Anthony Kennedy slipped out of the Supreme Court building on June 27, 2018, and traveled incognito to the White House to inform President Donald Trump that he was retiring, setting in motion a political process that his successor, Brett Kavanaugh, would denounce three months later as a “national disgrace” and a “circus.” Justice on Trial, the definitive insider’s account of Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Supreme Court, is based on extraordinary access to more than one hundred key figures—including the president, justices, and senators—in that ferocious political drama. The Trump presidency opened with the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to succeed the late Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. But the following year, when Trump drew from the same list of candidates for his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, the justice being replaced was the swing vote on abortion, and all hell broke loose. The judicial confirmation process, on the point of breakdown for thirty years, now proved utterly dysfunctional. Unverified accusations of sexual assault became weapons in a ruthless campaign of personal destruction, culminating in the melodramatic hearings in which Kavanaugh’s impassioned defense resuscitated a nomination that seemed beyond saving. The Supreme Court has become the arbiter of our nation’s most vexing and divisive disputes. With the stakes of each vacancy incalculably high, the incentive to destroy a nominee is nearly irresistible. The next time a nomination promises to change the balance of the Court, Hemingway and Severino warn, the confirmation fight will be even uglier than Kavanaugh’s. A good person might accept that nomination in the naïve belief that what happened to Kavanaugh won’t happen to him because he is a good person. But it can happen, it does happen, and it just happened. The question is whether America will let it happen again.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781621579847'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1621579840'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 375, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Political Science'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HpGMDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

President John F. Kennedy astonished the world on May 25, 1961, when he announced to Congress that the United States should land a man on the Moon by 1970. No group was more surprised than the scientists and engineers at NASA, who suddenly had less than a decade to invent space travel. When Kennedy announced that goal, no one knew how to navigate to the Moon. No one knew how to build a rocket big enough to reach the Moon, or how to build a computer small enough (and powerful enough) to fly a spaceship there. No one knew what the surface of the Moon was like, or what astronauts could eat as they flew there. On the day of Kennedy’s historic speech, America had a total of fifteen minutes of spaceflight experience—with just five of those minutes outside the atmosphere. Russian dogs had more time in space than U.S. astronauts. Over the next decade, more than 400,000 scientists, engineers, and factory workers would send 24 astronauts to the Moon. Each hour of space flight would require one million hours of work back on Earth to get America to the Moon on July 20, 1969. Fifty years later, One Giant Leap is the sweeping, definitive behind-the-scenes account of the furious race to complete one of mankind’s greatest achievements. It’s a story filled with surprises—from the item the astronauts almost forgot to take with them (the American flag), to the extraordinary impact Apollo would have back on Earth, and on the way we live today. Charles Fishman introduces readers to the men and women who had to solve 10,000 problems before astronauts could reach the Moon. From the research labs of MIT, where the eccentric and legendary pioneer Charles Draper created the tools to fly the Apollo spaceships, to the factories where dozens of women sewed spacesuits, parachutes, and even computer hardware by hand, Fishman captures the exceptional feats of these ordinary Americans. One Giant Leap is the captivating story of men and women charged with changing the world as we knew it—their leaders, their triumphs, their near disasters, all of which led to arguably the greatest success story, and the greatest adventure story, of the twentieth century.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781501106293'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1501106295'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 480, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['History'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=UtecDwAAQBAJ&dq=current+bestseller+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Trump. The 2016 election was a watershed for the United States. But, as Tim Alberta explains in American Carnage, to understand Trump’s victory is to view him not as the creator of this era of polarization and bruising partisanship, but rather as its most manifest consequence. American Carnage is the story of a president’s rise based on a country’s evolution and a party’s collapse. As George W. Bush left office with record-low approval ratings and Barack Obama led a Democratic takeover of Washington, Republicans faced a moment of reckoning: They had no vision, no generation of new leaders, and no energy in the party’s base. Yet Obama’s forceful pursuit of his progressive agenda, coupled with the nation’s rapidly changing cultural and demographic landscape, lit a fire under the right, returning Republicans to power and inviting a bloody struggle for the party’s identity in the post-Bush era. The factions that emerged—one led by absolutists like Jim Jordan and Ted Cruz, the other led by pragmatists like John Boehner and Mitch McConnell—engaged in a series of devastating internecine clashes and attempted coups for control. With the GOP’s internal fissures rendering it legislatively impotent, and that impotence fueling a growing resentment toward the political class and its institutions, the stage was set for an outsider to crash the party. When Trump descended a gilded escalator to announce his run in the summer of 2015, the candidate had met the moment. Only by viewing Trump as the culmination of a decade-long civil war inside the Republican Party—and of the parallel sense of cultural, socioeconomic, and technological disruption during that period—can we appreciate how he won the White House and consider the fundamental questions at the center of America’s current turmoil. How did a party obsessed with the national debt vote for trillion-dollar deficits and record-setting spending increases? How did the party of compassionate conservatism become the party of Muslim bans and walls? How did the party of family values elect a thrice-divorced philanderer? And, most important, how long can such a party survive? Loaded with exclusive reporting and based off hundreds of interviews—including with key players such as President Trump, Paul Ryan, Ted Cruz, John Boehner, Mitch McConnell, Jim DeMint, and Reince Priebus, and many others—American Carnage takes us behind the scenes of this tumultuous period as we’ve never seen it before and establishes Tim Alberta as the premier chronicler of this political era.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780062896360'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0062896369'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 688, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Political Science'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vwSdDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Levin comes a groundbreaking and enlightening book that shows how the great tradition of the American free press has degenerated into a standardless profession that has squandered the faith and trust of the American public, not through actions of government officials, but through its own abandonment of reportorial integrity and objective journalism. Unfreedom of the Press is not just another book about the press. Levin shows how those entrusted with news reporting today are destroying freedom of the press from within: “not government oppression or suppression,” he writes, but self-censorship, group-think, bias by omission, and passing off opinion, propaganda, pseudo-events, and outright lies as news. With the depth of historical background for which his books are renowned, Levin takes the reader on a journey through the early American patriot press, which proudly promoted the principles set forth in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, followed by the early decades of the Republic during which newspapers around the young country were open and transparent about their fierce allegiance to one political party or the other. It was only at the start of the Progressive Era and the twentieth century that the supposed “objectivity of the press” first surfaced, leaving us where we are today: with a partisan party-press overwhelmingly aligned with a political ideology but hypocritically engaged in a massive untruth as to its real nature.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781476773483'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1476773483'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 272, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Political Science'], 'averageRating': 5.0, 'ratingsCount': 1, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mq2ODwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

I fell in love with Eleanor, an eccentric and regimented loner whose life beautifully unfolds after a chance encounter with a stranger; I think you will fall in love, too!” —Reese Witherspoon No one’s ever told Eleanor that life should be better than fine. Meet Eleanor Oliphant: She struggles with appropriate social skills and tends to say exactly what she’s thinking. Nothing is missing in her carefully timetabled life of avoiding social interactions, where weekends are punctuated by frozen pizza, vodka, and phone chats with Mummy. But everything changes when Eleanor meets Raymond, the bumbling and deeply unhygienic IT guy from her office. When she and Raymond together save Sammy, an elderly gentleman who has fallen on the sidewalk, the three become the kinds of friends who rescue one another from the lives of isolation they have each been living. And it is Raymond’s big heart that will ultimately help Eleanor find the way to repair her own profoundly damaged one. Soon to be a major motion picture produced by Reese Witherspoon, Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine is the smart, warm, and uplifting story of an out-of-the-ordinary heroine whose deadpan weirdness and unconscious wit make for an irresistible journey as she realizes. . .

The #1 New York Times bestseller and Time #1 Nonfiction Book of the Year: Hillary Rodham Clinton’s most personal memoir yet, about the 2016 presidential election. In this “candid and blackly funny” (The New York Times) memoir, Hillary Rodham Clinton reveals what she was thinking and feeling during one of the most controversial and unpredictable presidential elections in history. She takes us inside the intense personal experience of becoming the first woman nominated for president by a major party in an election marked by rage, sexism, exhilarating highs and infuriating lows, stranger-than-fiction twists, Russian interference, and an opponent who broke all the rules. “At her most emotionally raw” (People), Hillary describes what it was like to run against Donald Trump, the mistakes she made, how she has coped with a shocking and devastating loss, and how she found the strength to pick herself back up afterward. She tells readers what it took to get back on her feet—the rituals, relationships, and reading that got her through, and what the experience has taught her about life. In this “feminist manifesto” (The New York Times), she speaks to the challenges of being a strong woman in the public eye, the criticism over her voice, age, and appearance, and the double standard confronting women in politics. Offering a “bracing... guide to our political arena” (The Washington Post), What Happened lays out how the 2016 election was marked by an unprecedented assault on our democracy by a foreign adversary. By analyzing the evidence and connecting the dots, Hillary shows just how dangerous the forces are that shaped the outcome, and why Americans need to understand them to protect our values and our democracy in the future. The election of 2016 was unprecedented and historic. What Happened is the story of that campaign, now with a new epilogue showing how Hillary grappled with many of her worst fears coming true in the Trump Era, while finding new hope in a surge of civic activism, women running for office, and young people marching in the streets.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781501175572'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1501175572'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 512, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Biography & Autobiography'], 'averageRating': 4.0, 'ratingsCount': 24, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UjAIDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

For decades, we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. \"F**k positivity,\" Mark Manson says. \"Let’s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it.\" In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up. Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited—\"not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault.\" Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek. There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780062457738'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '006245773X'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 224, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Self-Help'], 'averageRating': 3.0, 'ratingsCount': 19, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yng_CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

A brilliant and brave investigation into the medical and scientific revolution taking place around psychedelic drugs--and the spellbinding story of his own life-changing psychedelic experiences When Michael Pollan set out to research how LSD and psilocybin (the active ingredient in magic mushrooms) are being used to provide relief to people suffering from difficult-to-treat conditions such as depression, addiction and anxiety, he did not intend to write what is undoubtedly his most personal book. But upon discovering how these remarkable substances are improving the lives not only of the mentally ill but also of healthy people coming to grips with the challenges of everyday life, he decided to explore the landscape of the mind in the first person as well as the third. Thus began a singular adventure into various altered states of consciousness, along with a dive deep into both the latest brain science and the thriving underground community of psychedelic therapists. Pollan sifts the historical record to separate the truth about these mysterious drugs from the myths that have surrounded them since the 1960s, when a handful of psychedelic evangelists inadvertently catalyzed a powerful backlash against what was then a promising field of research. A unique and elegant blend of science, memoir, travel writing, history, and medicine, How to Change Your Mind is a triumph of participatory journalism. By turns dazzling and edifying, it is the gripping account of a journey to an exciting and unexpected new frontier in our understanding of the mind, the self, and our place in the world. The true subject of Pollan\\'s \"mental travelogue\" is not just psychedelic drugs but also the eternal puzzle of human consciousness and how, in a world that offers us both suffering and joy, we can do our best to be fully present and find meaning in our lives.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780525558941'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0525558942'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 480, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Body, Mind & Spirit'], 'averageRating': 4.0, 'ratingsCount': 11, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3vk5DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Which bestselling writer uses the most clichés? How can we judge a book by its cover? Data meets literature in this playful and informative look at our favorite authors and their masterpieces. “A literary detective story: fast-paced, thought-provoking, and intriguing.” —Brian Christian, coauthor of Algorithms to Live By There’s a famous piece of writing advice—offered by Ernest Hemingway, Stephen King, and myriad writers in between—not to use -ly adverbs like “quickly” or “fitfully.” It sounds like solid advice, but can we actually test it? If we were to count all the -ly adverbs these authors used in their careers, do they follow their own advice compared to other celebrated authors? What’s more, do great books in general—the classics and the bestsellers—share this trait? In Nabokov’s Favorite Word Is Mauve, statistician and journalist Ben Blatt brings big data to the literary canon, exploring the wealth of fun findings that remain hidden in the works of the world’s greatest writers. He assembles a database of thousands of books and hundreds of millions of words, and starts asking the questions that have intrigued curious word nerds and book lovers for generations: What are our favorite authors’ favorite words? Do men and women write differently? Are bestsellers getting dumber over time? Which bestselling writer uses the most clichés? What makes a great opening sentence? How can we judge a book by its cover? And which writerly advice is worth following or ignoring? Blatt draws upon existing analysis techniques and invents some of his own. All of his investigations and experiments are original, conducted himself, and no math knowledge is needed to understand the results. Blatt breaks his findings down into lucid, humorous language and clear and compelling visuals.

Can what you eat determine how long, and how well, you live? The clinically proven answer is yes, and The Longevity Diet is easier to follow than you'd think. The culmination of 25 years of research on ageing, nutrition, and disease across the globe, this unique combination of an everyday diet and fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) to be done only 3-4 times per year lays out a simple solution to living to a healthy old age through nutrition. FMD does away with the misery and starvation most of us experience while fasting and helps you reap all the beneficial health effects of a restrictive diet while avoiding the negative stressors, like low energy and sleeplessness. Valter Longo, Director of the Longevity Institute at USC and the Program on Longevity and Cancer at IFOM in Milan, developed THE FMD after making a series of remarkable discoveries in mice and humans indicating that specific diets can activate stem cells and promote regeneration and rejuvenation in multiple organs to reduce the risk for diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer's and heart disease. Longo's simple pescatarian daily eating plan and the periodic, fasting-mimicking techniques can both yield impressive results. Low in proteins and sugars and rich in healthy fats and plant-based foods, The Longevity Diet is clinically proven to help you: Lose weight and reduce abdominal fat Make simple changes which can extend the healthy lifespan Prevent age-related muscle and bone loss Build your resistance to diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's and cancer Longo's healthy, life span-extending plan is based on an easy-to-adopt pescatarian plan along with the fasting-mimicking diet 4 times a year, and just 5 days at a time.

In the predawn hours of March 4, 2002, just below the 10,469-foot peak of a mountain in eastern Afghanistan, a fierce battle raged. Outnumbered by Al Qaeda fighters, Air Force Combat Controller John Chapman and a handful of Navy SEALs struggled to take the summit in a desperate bid to find a lost teammate. Chapman, leading the charge, was gravely wounded in the initial assault. Believing he was dead, his SEAL leader ordered a retreat. Chapman regained consciousness alone, with the enemy closing in on three sides. John Chapman's subsequent display of incredible valor--first saving the lives of his SEAL teammates and then, knowing he was mortally wounded, single-handedly engaging two dozen hardened fighters to save the lives of an incoming rescue squad--posthumously earned him the Medal of Honor. Chapman is the first airman in nearly fifty years to be given the distinction reserved for America's greatest heroes. Alone at Dawn is also a behind-the-scenes look at the Air Force Combat Controllers: the world's deadliest and most versatile special operations force, whose members must not only exceed the qualifications of Navy SEAL and Army Delta Force teams but also act with sharp decisiveness and deft precision--even in the face of life-threatening danger. Drawing from firsthand accounts, classified documents, dramatic video footage, and extensive interviews with leaders and survivors of the operation, Alone at Dawn is the story of an extraordinary man's brave last stand and the brotherhood that forged him.\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781538729670'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1538729679'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 352, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Biography & Autobiography'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YtBuDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Includes a foreword by Barbara Ehrenreich. At 28, Stephanie Land\\'s plans of breaking free from the roots of her hometown in the Pacific Northwest to chase her dreams of attending a university and becoming a writer, were cut short when a summer fling turned into an unexpected pregnancy. She turned to housekeeping to make ends meet, and with a tenacious grip on her dream to provide her daughter the very best life possible, Stephanie worked days and took classes online to earn a college degree, and began to write relentlessly. She wrote the true stories that weren\\'t being told: the stories of overworked and underpaid Americans. Of living on food stamps and WIC (Women, Infants, and Children) coupons to eat. Of the government programs that provided her housing, but that doubled as halfway houses. The aloof government employees who called her lucky for receiving assistance while she didn\\'t feel lucky at all. She wrote to remember the fight, to eventually cut through the deep-rooted stigmas of the working poor. Maid explores the underbelly of upper-middle class America and the reality of what it\\'s like to be in service to them. \"I\\'d become a nameless ghost,\" Stephanie writes about her relationship with her clients, many of whom do not know her from any other cleaner, but who she learns plenty about. As she begins to discover more about her clients\\' lives-their sadness and love, too-she begins to find hope in her own path.

That tantalizing question propels a woman on a cross-country adventure to reunite with the men she loved and let go, in Danielle Steel’s exhilarating new novel. It all starts with a fall from a ladder, in a firehouse in New York City. The firehouse has been converted into a unique Manhattan home and studio where renowned photographer Madison Allen works and lives after raising three children on her own. But the accident, which happens while Maddie is sorting through long-forgotten personal mementos and photos, results in more than a broken ankle. It changes her life. Spurred by old memories, the forced pause in her demanding schedule, and an argument with her daughter that leads to a rare crisis of confidence, Maddie embarks on a road trip. She hopes to answer questions about the men she loved and might have married—but didn’t—in the years after she was left alone with three young children. Wearing a cast and driving a rented SUV, she sets off to reconnect with three very different men—one in Boston, one in Chicago, and another in Wyoming—to know once and for all if the decisions she made long ago were the right ones. Before moving forward into the future, she is compelled to confront the past.

And is Chip actually that funny in real life?

Even back then Chip was a serial entrepreneur who, among other things, ran a lawn care company, sold fireworks, and flipped houses. Soon they were married and living in their first fixer upper. Four children and countless renovations later, Joanna garners the attention of a television producer who notices her work on a blog one day.

John Wayne Gacy. Jeffrey Dahmer. The names of notorious serial killers are usually well-known; they echo in the news and in public consciousness. But most people have never heard of Israel Keyes, one of the most ambitious and terrifying serial killers in modern history. The FBI considered his behavior unprecedented. Described by a prosecutor as \"a force of pure evil,\" Keyes was a predator who struck all over the United States. He buried \"kill kits\"--cash, weapons, and body-disposal tools--in remote locations across the country. Over the course of fourteen years, Keyes would fly to a city, rent a car, and drive thousands of miles in order to use his kits. He would break into a stranger\\'s house, abduct his victims in broad daylight, and kill and dispose of them in mere hours. And then he would return home to Alaska, resuming life as a quiet, reliable construction worker devoted to his only daughter. When journalist Maureen Callahan first heard about Israel Keyes in 2012, she was captivated by how a killer of this magnitude could go undetected by law enforcement for over a decade. And so began a project that consumed her for the next several years--uncovering the true story behind how the FBI ultimately caught Israel Keyes, and trying to understand what it means for a killer like Keyes to exist. A killer who left a path of monstrous, randomly committed crimes in his wake--many of which remain unsolved to this day. American Predator is the ambitious culmination of years of interviews with key figures in law enforcement and in Keyes\\'s life, and research uncovered from classified FBI files. Callahan takes us on a journey into the chilling, nightmarish mind of a relentless killer, and to the limitations of traditional law enforcement.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780698191068'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0698191064'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 304, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['True Crime'], 'averageRating': 4.0, 'ratingsCount': 1, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2uV8DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Frankfurt'], 'publisher': 'Princeton University Press', 'publishedDate': '2009-01-10', 'description': 'A #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER One of the most salient features of our culture is that there is so much bullshit. Everyone knows this. Each of us contributes his share. But we tend to take the situation for granted. Most people are rather confident of their ability to recognize bullshit and to avoid being taken in by it. So the phenomenon has not aroused much deliberate concern. We have no clear understanding of what bullshit is, why there is so much of it, or what functions it serves. And we lack a conscientiously developed appreciation of what it means to us. In other words, as Harry Frankfurt writes, \"we have no theory.\" Frankfurt, one of the world\\'s most influential moral philosophers, attempts to build such a theory here. With his characteristic combination of philosophical acuity, psychological insight, and wry humor, Frankfurt proceeds by exploring how bullshit and the related concept of humbug are distinct from lying. He argues that bullshitters misrepresent themselves to their audience not as liars do, that is, by deliberately making false claims about what is true. In fact, bullshit need not be untrue at all. Rather, bullshitters seek to convey a certain impression of themselves without being concerned about whether anything at all is true. They quietly change the rules governing their end of the conversation so that claims about truth and falsity are irrelevant. Frankfurt concludes that although bullshit can take many innocent forms, excessive indulgence in it can eventually undermine the practitioner\\'s capacity to tell the truth in a way that lying does not. Liars at least acknowledge that it matters what is true. By virtue of this, Frankfurt writes, bullshit is a greater enemy of the truth than lies are.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1400826535'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781400826537'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 80, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Philosophy'], 'averageRating': 3.5, 'ratingsCount': 28, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bFpzNItiO7oC&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Hailed as \"the great nature writer of this generation\" (Wall Street Journal), Robert Macfarlane is the celebrated author of books about the intersections of the human and the natural realms. In Underland, he delivers his masterpiece: an epic exploration of the Earth’s underworlds as they exist in myth, literature, memory, and the land itself. In this highly anticipated sequel to his international bestseller The Old Ways, Macfarlane takes us on an extraordinary journey into our relationship with darkness, burial, and what lies beneath the surface of both place and mind. Traveling through “deep time”—the dizzying expanses of geologic time that stretch away from the present—he moves from the birth of the universe to a post-human future, from the prehistoric art of Norwegian sea caves to the blue depths of the Greenland ice cap, from Bronze Age funeral chambers to the catacomb labyrinth below Paris, and from the underground fungal networks through which trees communicate to a deep-sunk “hiding place” where nuclear waste will be stored for 100,000 years to come. “Woven through Macfarlane’s own travels are the unforgettable stories of descents into the underland made across history by explorers, artists, cavers, divers, mourners, dreamers, and murderers, all of whom have been drawn for different reasons to seek what Cormac McCarthy calls “the awful darkness within the world.” Global in its geography and written with great lyricism and power, Underland speaks powerfully to our present moment. Taking a deep-time view of our planet, Macfarlane here asks a vital and unsettling question: “Are we being good ancestors to the future Earth?” Underland marks a new turn in Macfarlane’s long-term mapping of the relations of landscape and the human heart. From its remarkable opening pages to its deeply moving conclusion, it is a journey into wonder, loss, fear, and hope.

If you've ever laughed your way through David Sedaris's cheerfully misanthropic stories, you might think you know what you're getting with Calypso. You'd be wrong. When he buys a beach house on the Carolina coast, Sedaris envisions long, relaxing vacations spent playing board games and lounging in the sun with those he loves most. And life at the Sea Section, as he names the vacation home, is exactly as idyllic as he imagined, except for one tiny, vexing realization: it's impossible to take a vacation from yourself. With Calypso, Sedaris sets his formidable powers of observation toward middle age and mortality. Make no mistake: these stories are very, very funny--it's a book that can make you laugh 'til you snort, the way only family can. Sedaris's powers of observation have never been sharper, and his ability to shock readers into laughter unparalleled.

More than a century old, the game of baseball is resistant to change—owners, managers, players, and fans all hate it. Yet, now more than ever, baseball needs to evolve—to compete with other professional sports, stay relevant, and remain America’s Pastime it must adapt. Perhaps no one knows this better than Bud Selig who, as the head of MLB for more than twenty years, ushered in some of the most important, and controversial, changes in the game’s history—modernizing a sport that had remained unchanged since the 1960s. In this enlightening and surprising book, Selig goes inside the most difficult decisions and moments of his career, looking at how he worked to balance baseball’s storied history with the pressures of the twenty-first century to ensure its future. Part baseball story, part business saga, and part memoir, For the Good of the Game chronicles Selig’s career, takes fans inside locker rooms and board rooms, and offers an intimate, fascinating account of the frequently messy process involved in transforming an American institution. Featuring an all-star lineup of the biggest names from the last forty years of baseball, Selig recalls the vital games, private moments, and tense conversations he’s shared with Hall of Fame players and managers and the contentious calls he’s made. He also speaks candidly about hot-button issues the steroid scandal that threatened to destroy the game, telling his side of the story in full and for the first time. As he looks back and forward, Selig outlines the stakes for baseball’s continued transformation—and why the changes he helped usher in must only be the beginning.

Tom Volpe is a single dad working multiple jobs while struggling to raise his headstrong daughter, Lyla. His road has been lonely, long, and hard, but he finally starts to relax after Lyla earns a scholarship to Windsor Academy, Nashville’s most prestigious private school.

In Liane Moriarty’s latest page-turner, nine perfect strangers are about to find out... Nine people gather at a remote health resort. Some are here to lose weight, some are here to get a reboot on life, some are here for reasons they can’t even admit to themselves. Amidst all of the luxury and pampering, the mindfulness and meditation, they know these ten days might involve some real work. But none of them could imagine just how challenging the next ten days are going to be. Frances Welty, the formerly best-selling romantic novelist, arrives at Tranquillum House nursing a bad back, a broken heart, and an exquisitely painful paper cut. She’s immediately intrigued by her fellow guests. Most of them don’t look to be in need of a health resort at all. But the person that intrigues her most is the strange and charismatic owner/director of Tranquillum House. Could this person really have the answers Frances didn’t even know she was seeking? Should Frances put aside her doubts and immerse herself in everything Tranquillum House has to offer – or should she run while she still can? It’s not long before every guest at Tranquillum House is asking exactly the same question. Combining all of the hallmarks that have made her writing a go-to for anyone looking for wickedly smart, page-turning fiction that will make you laugh and gasp, Liane Moriarty’s Nine Perfect Strangers once again shows why she is a master of her craft.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781250069849'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '125006984X'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 432, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Fiction'], 'averageRating': 3.5, 'ratingsCount': 40, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pOxWDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Much like human families, tree parents live together with their children, communicate with them, and support them as they grow, sharing nutrients with those who are sick or struggling and creating an ecosystem that mitigates the impact of extremes of heat and cold for the whole group. As a result of such interactions, trees in a family or community are protected and can live to be very old. In contrast, solitary trees, like street kids, have a tough time of it and in most cases die much earlier than those in a group. Drawing on groundbreaking new discoveries, Wohlleben presents the science behind the secret and previously unknown life of trees and their communication abilities; he describes how these discoveries have informed his own practices in the forest around him.

Why do some of these books remain popular for centuries, and others fade gently into obscurity? And why is it that when scholars do turn their attention to bestsellers, they seem only to be interested in the same handful of blockbusters, when so many books that were once immensely popular remain under-examined? Addressing those and other equally pressing questions about popular literature, Must Read is the first scholarly collection to offer both a survey of the evolution of American bestsellers as well as critical readings of some of the key texts that have shaped the American imagination since the nation's founding. Focusing on a mix of enduring and forgotten bestsellers, the essays in this collection consider 18th and 19th century works, like Charlotte Temple or Ben-Hur, that were once considered epochal but are now virtually ignored; 20th century favorites such as The Sheik and Peyton Place; and 21st century blockbusters including the novels of Nicholas Sparks, The Kite Runner, and The Da Vinci Code.\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781441195135'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1441195130'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 384, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Literary Criticism'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=46xXIHOmEqwC&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Mark disappears emotionally without warning. Now Sadie has disappeared, leaving Mark and her family wracked with worry.

David Brock is the ultimate happy warrior. Once a leading right-wing hit man, Brock is now the Left's pre-eminent defender and truth-teller. In this incisive, personal account, Brock disarms the major tentacles of the Republican Leviathan: the Koch Brothers, the Clinton haters, and the Fox Noise Machine. With the acumen of a seasoned political player, Brock takes readers inside his Democratic war rooms and their 24/7 battles with right-wing forces for control of the story lines and messages that will decide the 2016 election. And he chronicles his own evolution from lead Clinton attack-dog to one of Hillary Clinton's fiercest defenders as he knocks down the conservative case against her.

The modern American hospital is that establishment and Unaccountable is that book.”-Shannon Brownlee, author of Overtreated Dr. Marty Makary is co-developer of the life-saving checklist outlined in Atul Gawande's bestselling The Checklist Manifesto. As a busy surgeon who has worked in many of the best hospitals in the nation, he can testify to the amazing power of modern medicine to cure. But he's also been a witness to a medical culture that routinely leaves surgical sponges inside patients, amputates the wrong limbs, and overdoses children because of sloppy handwriting. Over the last ten years, neither error rates nor costs have come down, despite scientific progress and efforts to curb expenses. Why? To patients, the healthcare system is a black box. Doctors and hospitals are unaccountable, and the lack of transparency leaves both bad doctors and systemic flaws unchecked.

Stein practices what he teaches: He is the author of nine novels, including the million-copy bestseller The Magician, as well as editor of such major writers as James Baldwin, Jack Higgins, Elia Kazan, Budd Schulberg, W. H. Auden, and Jacques Barzun, and the teacher and editor of several current bestselling authors. What sets Stein apart is his practical approach. He provides specific techniques that speed writers to successful publication. How to Grow a Novel is not just a book, but an invaluable workshop in print. It includes details and examples from Stein's editorial work with a #1 bestselling novelist as well as talented newcomers. Stein takes the reader backstage in the development of memorable characters and fascinating plots. The chapter on dialogue overflows with solutions for short-story writers, novelists, screenwriters, and playwrights. Stein shows what readers are looking for-- and what they avoid-- in the experience of reading fiction. The book offers guidelines-- and warnings-- of special value for nonfiction writers who want to move into fiction. Stein points to the little, often overlooked things that damage the writer's authority without the writer knowing it. And this book, like no other writing book, takes the reader behind the scenes of the publishing business as it affects writers of every level of experience, revealing the hard truths that are kept behind shut doors.\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781466865006'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1466865008'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 288, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Reference'], 'averageRating': 3.5, 'ratingsCount': 2, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VgVlAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

And if Joyce has her way, the revolution will spread - person by person, house by house, town by town, until the old culture of selfishness and greed gives way to a new culture of concern for others. The book is a revolutionaries' manual, a hands-on primer for bringing the Golden Rule to life in the twenty-first century. Meyer starts out by giving some stunning statistics. Right now...210,000 children will die this week because of poverty; 640 million children do not have adequate shelter; every day, 3,000 children are abducted into the sex-trafficking industry; every day, 16,000 children die from hunger-related causes. She goes on to say that although crisis is global, the solution is local. We can't solve the world's problems, but that isn't a reason to remain idle. LOVE REVOLUTION focuses on personal behavior on the local scale.

In the years since his pioneering work 2012, Daniel Pinchbeck has touched a legion of readers hungry for insight and guidance about new ways of living amid the crises of the current moment. Notes from the Edge Times collects Pinchbeck's most penetrating recent columns, articles, and essays that amount to an extraordinary mosaic view of the hopes, nightmares, and signs of breakthrough that mark our present era. Pinchbeck examines the current economic collapse (an event he had foreseen by many months), radical political and ecological alternatives, the uses of psychedelics for spiritual insight, the revival of the sexual revolution, unexplained phenomena such as crop circles and the Norway spiral, the imminent (and often-misunderstood) question of 2012, and what it means to be an artist in a time of radical change. Pinchbeck's virtuosity as a social critic, on full display in these pieces, is his ability to illuminate real and serious questions within unconventional topics that most literary intellects are unwilling to touch, from secret weapons systems to extrasensory abilities to the intelligence of plant life.

Gas lamps still flicker in the city streets, but the miracle of electric light is in its infancy. The person who controls the means to turn night into day will make history—and a vast fortune. A young untested lawyer named Paul Cravath, fresh out of Columbia Law School, takes a case that seems impossible to win. Paul’s client, George Westinghouse, has been sued by Thomas Edison over a billion-dollar question: Who invented the light bulb and holds the right to power the country? The case affords Paul entry to the heady world of high society—the glittering parties in Gramercy Park mansions, and the more insidious dealings done behind closed doors. The task facing him is beyond daunting. Edison is a wily, dangerous opponent with vast resources at his disposal—private spies, newspapers in his pocket, and the backing of J. P. Morgan himself. Yet this unknown lawyer shares with his famous adversary a compulsion to win at all costs. How will he do it? In obsessive pursuit of victory, Paul crosses paths with Nikola Tesla, an eccentric, brilliant inventor who may hold the key to defeating Edison, and with Agnes Huntington, a beautiful opera singer who proves to be a flawless performer on stage and off. As Paul takes greater and greater risks, he’ll find that everyone in his path is playing their own game, and no one is quite who they seem. Praise for The Last Days of Night “A satisfying romp . . .

You feel it in your workplace. You feel it when you talk to your kids. You can’t miss it when you read the newspapers or watch the news. Our lives are being transformed in so many realms all at once—and it is dizzying. In Thank You for Being Late, version 2.0, with a new afterword, Thomas L. Friedman exposes the tectonic movements that are reshaping the world today and explains how to get the most out of them and cushion their worst impacts. His thesis: to understand the twenty-first century, you need to understand that the planet’s three largest forces—Moore’s law (technology), the Market (globalization), and Mother Nature (climate change and biodiversity loss)—are accelerating all at once. These accelerations are transforming five key realms: the workplace, politics, geopolitics, ethics, and community. The year 2007 was the major inflection point: the release of the iPhone, together with advances in silicon chips, software, storage, sensors, and networking, created a new technology platform that is reshaping everything from how we hail a taxi to the fate of nations to our most intimate relationships. It is providing vast new opportunities for individuals and small groups to save the world—or to destroy it. With his trademark vitality, wit, and optimism, Friedman shows that we can overcome the multiple stresses of an age of accelerations—if we slow down, if we dare to be late and use the time to reimagine work, politics, and community.

Working at the intersection of literary history, lived religion, and consumer culture, Erin A. Smith considers the largely unexplored world of popular religious books, examining the apparent tension between economic and religious imperatives for authors, publishers, and readers. Smith argues that this literature served as a form of extra-ecclesiastical ministry and credits the popularity and longevity of religious books to their day-to-day usefulness rather than their theological correctness or aesthetic quality. Drawing on publishers' records, letters by readers to authors, promotional materials, and interviews with contemporary religious-reading groups, Smith offers a comprehensive study that finds surprising overlap across the religious spectrum--Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish, liberal and conservative. Smith tells the story of how authors, publishers, and readers reconciled these books' dual function as best-selling consumer goods and spiritually edifying literature. What Would Jesus Read? will be of interest to literary and cultural historians, students in the field of print culture, and scholars of religious studies.\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781469621333'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1469621339'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 410, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Religion'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GEahBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Colin Campbell'], 'publisher': 'BenBella Books, Inc.', 'publishedDate': '2013-05-07', 'description': 'New York Times Bestseller What happens when you eat an apple? The answer is vastly more complex than you imagine. Every apple contains thousands of antioxidants whose names, beyond a few like vitamin C, are unfamiliar to us, and each of these powerful chemicals has the potential to play an important role in supporting our health. They impact thousands upon thousands of metabolic reactions inside the human body. But calculating the specific influence of each of these chemicals isn’t nearly sufficient to explain the effect of the apple as a whole. Because almost every chemical can affect every other chemical, there is an almost infinite number of possible biological consequences. And that’s just from an apple. Nutritional science, long stuck in a reductionist mindset, is at the cusp of a revolution. The traditional “gold standard” of nutrition research has been to study one chemical at a time in an attempt to determine its particular impact on the human body. These sorts of studies are helpful to food companies trying to prove there is a chemical in milk or pre-packaged dinners that is “good” for us, but they provide little insight into the complexity of what actually happens in our bodies or how those chemicals contribute to our health. In The China Study, T. Colin Campbell (alongside his son, Thomas M. Campbell) revolutionized the way we think about our food with the evidence that a whole food, plant-based diet is the healthiest way to eat. Now, in Whole, he explains the science behind that evidence, the ways our current scientific paradigm ignores the fascinating complexity of the human body, and why, if we have such overwhelming evidence that everything we think we know about nutrition is wrong, our eating habits haven’t changed. Whole is an eye-opening, paradigm-changing journey through cutting-edge thinking on nutrition, a scientific tour de force with powerful implications for our health and for our world.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781937856250'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1937856259'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 352, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Health & Fitness'], 'averageRating': 3.5, 'ratingsCount': 5, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=S2cCyLkw2J0C&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Drawing on a wide range of examples, from the expanding drone assassination program to the threat of nuclear warfare, as well as the flashpoints of Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, and Israel/Palestine, he offers unexpected and nuanced insights into the workings of imperial power on our increasingly chaotic planet. In the process, Chomsky provides a brilliant anatomy of just how U.S. elites have grown ever more insulated from any democratic constraints on their power. While the broader population is lulled into apathy—diverted to consumerism or hatred of the vulnerable—the corporations and the rich have increasingly been allowed to do as they please.

In the 2018 New York Times bestseller The Case Against Impeaching Trump, Alan Dershowitz lamented how American political discourse has devolved into hypocrisy and the criminalization of political differences in the rush to impeach President Donald Trump. Arguments to impeach Trump failed Dershowitz’s “shoe on the other foot test,” or his political golden rule: Democrats must do unto Republicans what they would have Republicans do unto them, and vice versa. Since then, we’ve only become more divided―and the impeachment power wielded by the new Democratic majority in the House of Representative threatens to further polarize the country. The Case Against the Democratic House Impeaching Trump includes and expands upon Dershowitz’s 2018 book. It puts recent political events―including the hyper-partisan Kavanaugh hearings, the unrestrained power of the Mueller investigation, and the generally intolerant current political discourse―into context. American democracy, Dershowitz argues, is suffering from political hypocrisy. And two years of impeachment proceedings brought by the House―and the media circus that would undoubtedly surround them―is clearly not the answer. This book is Alan Dershowitz’s plea for honest dialogue―for arguments that would be made even if the shoe was on the other foot.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781510747715'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1510747710'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 264, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Political Science'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=afaBDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Which might explain why he finds himself chatting up a telemarketer as if she’s a long-lost friend. But Wendy is surprisingly easy to talk to, so when they go from occasional calls during her work, to nightly conversations on their cells, it somehow feels right. So right, Blade eventually convinces the funny, sweet woman to meet him in person. When their first face-to-face meeting gets high-jacked, Wendy Tucker is sure she and Aspen made a big mistake in taking their relationship to the next level. But the man is nothing if not persistent. Before long, Wendy’s allowing the handsome soldier to spend more time with her and Jack, the teen brother she’s raising, than anyone she’s ever dated. Though she knows there are limits to how close she can get to Aspen, no matter how much she likes him. Limits carefully constructed to protect Wendy and Jack from a past they’ve been running from for years. But dating Blade means having an entire team of Deltas at her back. Which may come in handy not just with Wendy’s past…but also when her brother faces a current threat. **Rescuing Wendy is the 8th book in the Delta Force Heroes Series.

In How to Hear from God, Joyce Meyer shows readers that God reaches out to people every day, seeking a partnership with them to offer guidance and love. She reveals the ways in which God delivers His word and the benefits of asking God for the sensitivity to hear His voice.

The Fates Divide is a richly imagined tale of hope and resilience told in four stunning perspectives. The lives of Cyra Noavek and Akos Kereseth are ruled by their fates, spoken by the oracles at their births. The fates, once determined, are inescapable. Akos is in love with Cyra, in spite of his fate: He will die in service to Cyra’s family. And when Cyra’s father, Lazmet Noavek—a soulless tyrant, thought to be dead—reclaims the Shotet throne, Akos believes his end is closer than ever. As Lazmet ignites a barbaric war, Cyra and Akos are desperate to stop him at any cost. For Cyra, that could mean taking the life of the man who may—or may not—be her father. For Akos, it could mean giving his own. In a stunning twist, the two will discover how fate defines their lives in ways most unexpected.

From the very beginning of its statehood in 1948, protecting the nation from harm has been the responsibility of its intelligence community and armed services, and there is one weapon in their vast arsenal that they have relied upon to thwart the most serious threats: Targeted assassinations have been used countless times, on enemies large and small, sometimes in response to attacks against the Israeli people and sometimes preemptively. In this page-turning, eye-opening book, journalist and military analyst Ronen Bergman—praised by David Remnick as “arguably [Israel’s] best investigative reporter”—offers a riveting inside account of the targeted killing programs: their successes, their failures, and the moral and political price exacted on the men and women who approved and carried out the missions. Bergman has gained the exceedingly rare cooperation of many current and former members of the Israeli government, including Prime Ministers Shimon Peres, Ehud Barak, Ariel Sharon, and Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as high-level figures in the country’s military and intelligence services: the IDF (Israel Defense Forces), the Mossad (the world’s most feared intelligence agency), Caesarea (a “Mossad within the Mossad” that carries out attacks on the highest-value targets), and the Shin Bet (an internal security service that implemented the largest targeted assassination campaign ever, in order to stop what had once appeared to be unstoppable: suicide terrorism). Including never-before-reported, behind-the-curtain accounts of key operations, and based on hundreds of on-the-record interviews and thousands of files to which Bergman has gotten exclusive access over his decades of reporting, Rise and Kill First brings us deep into the heart of Israel’s most secret activities. Bergman traces, from statehood to the present, the gripping events and thorny ethical questions underlying Israel’s targeted killing campaign, which has shaped the Israeli nation, the Middle East, and the entire world. “A remarkable feat of fearless and responsible reporting . . . important, timely, and informative.”—John le Carré', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780679604686'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0679604685'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 784, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['History'], 'averageRating': 5.0, 'ratingsCount': 1, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3UXKDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

It is responsible for broken relationships, sleepless nights, high blood pressure and ulcers. It destroys friendships, marriages and families, not to mention peace of mind. Anger is especially hard to handle for many Christians who have learned from childhood that \"good Christians don\\'t get angry.\" Meyer argues that properly handled, anger is an alert system that something is wrong and needs to be resolved. In her latest book, she delves into the important process of forgiving, explaining its positive impact on the roots, the forms and the results of anger. Why forgive? Joyce explains that forgiving is the only thing that can free one from the terrible turmoil that anger causes to spill over into every part of life. Meyer understands that life will never be fair, but that is not a reason to let anger destroy our well-being and health.

France’s unquiet histories are brought to life by a master storyteller.” —Financial Times (UK) A story of resistance, complicity, and an unlikely, transformative friendship, set in Paris, from internationally bestselling novelist Sebastian Faulks. American historian Hannah intends to immerse herself in World War II research in Paris, wary of paying much attention to the city where a youthful misadventure once left her dejected. But a chance encounter with Tariq, a Moroccan teenager whose visions of the City of Lights as a world of opportunity and rebirth starkly contrast with her own, disrupts her plan. Hannah agrees to take Tariq in as a lodger, forming an unexpected connection with the young man. Yet as Tariq begins to assimilate into the country he risked his life to enter, he realizes that its dark past and current ills are far more complicated than he’d anticipated. And Hannah, diving deeper into her work on women’s lives in Nazi-occupied Paris, uncovers a shocking piece of history that threatens to dismantle her core beliefs. Soon they each must question which sacrifices are worth their happiness and what, if anything, the tumultuous past century can teach them about the future.

In his bestselling book The World Without Us, Alan Weisman considered how the Earth could heal and even refill empty niches if relieved of humanity's constant pressures. Behind that groundbreaking thought experiment was his hope that we would be inspired to find a way to add humans back to this vision of a restored, healthy planet-only in harmony, not mortal combat, with the rest of nature. But with a million more of us every 4 1/2 days on a planet that's not getting any bigger, and with our exhaust overheating the atmosphere and altering the chemistry of the oceans, prospects for a sustainable human future seem ever more in doubt. For this long awaited follow-up book, Weisman traveled to more than 20 countries to ask what experts agreed were probably the most important questions on Earth--and also the hardest: How many humans can the planet hold without capsizing? How robust must the Earth's ecosystem be to assure our continued existence? Can we know which other species are essential to our survival? And, how might we actually arrive at a stable, optimum population, and design an economy to allow genuine prosperity without endless growth? Weisman visits an extraordinary range of the world's cultures, religions, nationalities, tribes, and political systems to learn what in their beliefs, histories, liturgies, or current circumstances might suggest that sometimes it's in their own best interest to limit their growth. The result is a landmark work of reporting: devastating, urgent, and, ultimately, deeply hopeful. By vividly detailing the burgeoning effects of our cumulative presence, Countdown reveals what may be the fastest, most acceptable, practical, and affordable way of returning our planet and our presence on it to balance. Weisman again shows that he is one of the most provocative journalists at work today, with a book whose message is so compelling that it will change how we see our lives and our destiny.\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780316236508'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0316236500'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 528, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Nature'], 'averageRating': 4.5, 'ratingsCount': 3, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t28FlWXoig0C&source=gbs_api'}\n",

In a war he wanted no part of, they systematically destroyed everything he’d ever cared for. Now he waits for the day when evolution will finally rid him of the human vermin. Medea was born the granddaughter of the Greek god Apollo, and among the first of his people that he cursed to die. But she will not let anyone rule her life. Not even her notorious grandfather. And when Apollo sends a new plague to destroy what remains of her people, she refuses to stand by and watch him take everything she loves from her again. This time, she knows of a secret weapon that can stop the ancient god and his army of demons. Once and for all. However, said device is in the hands of a dragon who wants nothing to do with politics, the gods, humanity, demons or Apollites. And especially not her. He is the immovable object. She is the unstoppable force . . . When Apollo makes a strategic move that backfires, he forces Falcyn back into play. Now Medea either has the weapon she needs to save her people, or she’s unleashed total Armageddon. If she can’t find some way to control the dragon before it’s too late, Falcyn will be an even worse plague on the world than the one Apollo has set loose.

Let’s face it: Greg Heffley will never change his wimpy ways. Somebody just needs to explain that to Greg’s father. You see, Frank Heffley actually thinks he can get his son to toughen up, and he enlists Greg in organized sports and other “manly” endeavors. Of course, Greg is able to easily sidestep his father’s efforts to change him. But when Greg’s dad threatens to send him to military academy, Greg realizes he has to shape up . . . or get shipped out. Greg and his family and friends, who make the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books a must-read for middle school readers, are back and at their best in this hilarious new installment of the series, which is sure to please current fans while attracting new ones. Publishers Weekly-1/19/2009: The third book in this genre-busting series is certain to enlarge Kinney’s presence on the bestseller lists, where the previous titles have taken up residence for the past two years. Kinney’s spot-on humor and winning formula of deadpan text set against cartoons are back in full force. This time, Greg starts off on New Year’s Day (he resolves to “help other people improve,” telling his mother, “I think you should work on chewing your potato chips more quietly”) and ends with summer vacation. As he fends off his father’s attempts to make him more of a man (the threat of military school looms), Greg’s hapless adventures include handing out anonymous valentines expressing his true feelings (“Dear James, You smell”), attempting to impress his classmate Holly and single-handedly wrecking his soccer team’s perfect season. Kinney allows himself some insider humor as well, with Greg noting the “racket” children’s book authors have going. “All you have to do is make up a character with a snappy name, and then make sure the character learns a lesson at the end of the book.” Greg, self-centered as ever, may be the exception proving that rule.

What happens after the sale has taken place, if problems then occur? How are they dealt with, and what processes can be implemented to make sure that they are dealt with more cost effectively for the company, at the same time improving customer service and increasing sales? The book starts by describing some of the historical practices and then attempts to remove some of the myths of aftersales service by explaining the legal position on customer rights. It then moves onto trying to understand what customers wants, what sales people want and how these points interface with the needs of the teams within the rest of a retailer's company. From this, the next step is to design the new aftersales proposition and understanding of the key pressure point which is the time taken to resolve any problems. After this, the book moves onto implementation, explaining how to manage key stakeholders both within the business (i.e. the various business functions and departments) and outside (such as manufacturers and suppliers). There is a section on reporting systems and structures and there are worked examples to show readers just how much of a saving they can make if the changes are made. Finally, there is a chapter on how to both manage the implementation the necessary changes and more importantly hold onto the gains madeThe book is of use in resolving the problems of any retailer but principally it is aimed at sellers of larger goods\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780749458614'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0749458615'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 224, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Business & Economics'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=NRForrydv0AC&dq=current+bestseller+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

They come together by chance in the heart of New York City, four young women at turning points in their lives. Claire Kelly finds the walk-up apartment—a spacious loft in Hell’s Kitchen. But the aspiring shoe designer needs at least one roommate to manage it. She meets Abby Williams, a writer trying to make it on her own, far away from her successful family in L.A. Four years later, Morgan Shelby joins them. She’s ambitious, with a serious finance job on Wall Street. Then Sasha Hartman, a medical student whose identical twin sister is a headline-grabbing supermodel. And so the sprawling space, with its exposed brick and rich natural light, becomes a home to friends about to embark on new, exhilarating adventures. Frustrated by her ultra-conservative boss, Claire soon faces a career crisis as a designer. Abby is under the spell of an older man, an off-off-Broadway producer who exploits her and detours her from her true talent as a novelist, while destroying her self-confidence. Morgan is happily in love with a successful restaurateur who supplies her roommates with fine food. At her office, she begins to suspect something is off about her boss, a legendary investment manager whom she’s always admired. But does she even know him?

Their shared life in the apartment grounds them as they bring one another comfort and become a family of beloved friends.

In the dead of winter, outside a small Minnesota town, state troopers pull two young women and their car from the icy Black Root River. One is found downriver, drowned, while the other is found at the scene—half frozen but alive. What happened was no accident, and news of the crime awakens the community’s memories of another young woman who lost her life in the same river ten years earlier, and whose killer may still live among them. Determined to find answers, the surviving young woman soon realizes that she’s connected to the earlier unsolved case by more than just a river, and the deeper she plunges into her own investigation, the closer she comes to dangerous truths, and to the violence that simmers just below the surface of her hometown. Grief, suspicion, the innocent and the guilty—all stir to life in this cold northern town where a young woman can come home, but still not be safe. Brilliantly plotted and unrelentingly propulsive, The Current is a beautifully realized story about the fragility of life, the power of the past, and the need, always, to fight back.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781616208899'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1616208899'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 352, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Fiction'], 'averageRating': 3.5, 'ratingsCount': 7, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JXhMDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

This wide-ranging and meticulously researched two-volume study presents the most thorough current defense of the credibility of the miracle reports in the Gospels and Acts.

There are ways and means of getting about that don't involve four wheels, but in this slice of vintage Clarkson, Jeremy isn't much interested in them. Back in 1996, he took himself off to twelve countries (okay, eleven - he goes to America twice) in search of the hows, whys and wherefores of different nationalities and their relationships with cars. There were a few questions he needed answers to: • Why, for instance, is it that Italians are more interested in looking good than looking where they are going? • Why do Indians crash a lot? • How can an Arab describe himself as 'not a rich man' with four of the world's most expensive cars in his drive? • And why have the otherwise neutral Swiss declared war on the car? From Cuba to Iceland, Australia to Vietnam, Japan to Texas, Jeremy Clarkson tells us of his adventures on and off four wheels as he seeks to discover just what it is that makes our motorworld tick over.

In the dead of winter, outside a small Minnesota town, state troopers pull two young women and their car from the icy Black Root River. One is found downriver, drowned, while the other is found at the scene—half frozen but alive. What happened was no accident, and news of the crime awakens the community’s memories of another young woman who lost her life in the same river ten years earlier, and whose killer may still live among them. Determined to find answers, the surviving young woman soon realizes that she’s connected to the earlier unsolved case by more than just a river, and the deeper she plunges into her own investigation, the closer she comes to dangerous truths, and to the violence that simmers just below the surface of her hometown. Grief, suspicion, the innocent and the guilty—all stir to life in this cold northern town where a young woman can come home, but still not be safe.

This wide-ranging and meticulously researched two-volume study presents the most thorough current defense of the credibility of the miracle reports in the Gospels and Acts.

On the morning of April 29, 1986, a fire alarm sounded in the Los Angeles Public Library. As the moments passed, the patrons and staff who had been cleared out of the building realized this was not the usual fire alarm. As one fireman recounted, “Once that first stack got going, it was ‘Goodbye, Charlie.’” The fire was disastrous: it reached 2000 degrees and burned for more than seven hours. By the time it was extinguished, it had consumed four hundred thousand books and damaged seven hundred thousand more. Investigators descended on the scene, but more than thirty years later, the mystery remains: Did someone purposefully set fire to the library—and if so, who? Weaving her lifelong love of books and reading into an investigation of the fire, award-winning New Yorker reporter and New York Times bestselling author Susan Orlean delivers a mesmerizing and uniquely compelling book that manages to tell the broader story of libraries and librarians in a way that has never been done before. In The Library Book, Orlean chronicles the LAPL fire and its aftermath to showcase the larger, crucial role that libraries play in our lives; delves into the evolution of libraries across the country and around the world, from their humble beginnings as a metropolitan charitable initiative to their current status as a cornerstone of national identity; brings each department of the library to vivid life through on-the-ground reporting; studies arson and attempts to burn a copy of a book herself; reflects on her own experiences in libraries; and reexamines the case of Harry Peak, the blond-haired actor long suspected of setting fire to the LAPL more than thirty years ago. Along the way, Orlean introduces us to an unforgettable cast of characters from libraries past and present—from Mary Foy, who in 1880 at eighteen years old was named the head of the Los Angeles Public Library at a time when men still dominated the role, to Dr. C.J.K. Jones, a pastor, citrus farmer, and polymath known as “The Human Encyclopedia” who roamed the library dispensing information; from Charles Lummis, a wildly eccentric journalist and adventurer who was determined to make the L.A. library one of the best in the world, to the current staff, who do heroic work every day to ensure that their institution remains a vital part of the city it serves. Brimming with her signature wit, insight, compassion, and talent for deep research, The Library Book is Susan Orlean’s thrilling journey through the stacks that reveals how these beloved institutions provide much more than just books—and why they remain an essential part of the heart, mind, and soul of our country. It is also a master journalist’s reminder that, perhaps especially in the digital era, they are more necessary than ever.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781476740201'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1476740208'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 336, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['History'], 'averageRating': 4.0, 'ratingsCount': 56, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OcNWDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

He lays bare the 2008 financial crisis—the greatest since the 1930s—tracing it to the failure of regulation to keep pace with an out-of-control financial system.

TIME Magazine\\'s \"Best Memoirs of 2018 So Far.\" O, Oprah’s Magazine’s “10 Titles to Pick Up Now.” Politics & Current Events 2018 O.W.L. Book Awards Winner The Root Best of 2018 \"This remarkable book reveals what inspired Patrisse\\'s visionary and courageous activism and forces us to face the consequence of the choices our nation made when we criminalized a generation. This book is a must-read for all of us.\" - Michelle Alexander, New York Times bestselling author of The New Jim Crow A poetic and powerful memoir about what it means to be a Black woman in America—and the co-founding of a movement that demands justice for all in the land of the free. Raised by a single mother in an impoverished neighborhood in Los Angeles, Patrisse Khan-Cullors experienced firsthand the prejudice and persecution Black Americans endure at the hands of law enforcement. For Patrisse, the most vulnerable people in the country are Black people. Deliberately and ruthlessly targeted by a criminal justice system serving a white privilege agenda, Black people are subjected to unjustifiable racial profiling and police brutality. In 2013, when Trayvon Martin’s killer went free, Patrisse’s outrage led her to co-found Black Lives Matter with Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi. Condemned as terrorists and as a threat to America, these loving women founded a hashtag that birthed the movement to demand accountability from the authorities who continually turn a blind eye to the injustices inflicted upon people of Black and Brown skin. Championing human rights in the face of violent racism, Patrisse is a survivor. She transformed her personal pain into political power, giving voice to a people suffering inequality and a movement fueled by her strength and love to tell the country—and the world—that Black Lives Matter. When They Call You a Terrorist is Patrisse Khan-Cullors and asha bandele’s reflection on humanity. It is an empowering account of survival, strength and resilience and a call to action to change the culture that declares innocent Black life expendable.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781250171092'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1250171091'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 304, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Biography & Autobiography'], 'averageRating': 4.5, 'ratingsCount': 12, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6l4mDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Memetics is the science of memes, the invisible but very real DNA of human society. In Virus of the Mind, Richard Brodie carefully builds on the work of scientists Richard Dawkins, Douglas Hofstadter, Daniel Dennett, and others who have become fascinated with memes and their potential impact on our lives. But Richard goes beyond science and dives into the meat of the issue: is the emergence of this new science going to have an impact on our lives like the emergence of atomic physics did in the Cold War? He would say the impact will be at least as great. While atomic bombs affect everybody’s life, viruses of the mind touch lives in a more personal and more pernicious way. Mind viruses have already infected governments, educational systems, and inner cities, leading to some of the most pervasive and troublesome problems of society today: youth gangs, the welfare cycle, the deterioration of the public schools, and ever?growing government bureaucracy. Viruses of the mind are not a future worry: they are here with us now and are evolving to become better and better at their job of infecting us. The recent explosion of mass media and the information superhighway has made the earth a prime breeding ground for viruses of the mind. Will there be a mental plague? Will only some of us survive with our free will intact?

The checks and balances that protected Athenian society from tyrants, such as legal assassination and ostracism, are described. Selected inscriptions are illustrated and discussed, as are ingenious devices such as allotment machines and water clocks, which ensured fairness in the courts.

As human beings, we continually tell ourselves stories -- of success or failure; of power or victimhood; stories that endure for an hour, or a day, or an entire lifetime. We have stories about our work, our families and relationships, our health; about what we want and what we\\'re capable of achieving. Yet, while our stories profoundly affect how others see us and we see ourselves, too few of us even recognize that we\\'re telling stories, or what they are, or that we can change them -- and, in turn, transform our very destinies. Telling ourselves stories provides structure and direction as we navigate life\\'s challenges and opportunities, and helps us interpret our goals and skills. Stories make sense of chaos; they organize our many divergent experiences into a coherent thread; they shape our entire reality. And far too many of our stories, says Loehr, are dysfunctional, in need of serious editing. First, he asks you to answer the question, \"In which areas of my life is it clear that I cannot achieve my goals with the story I\\'ve got?\" He then shows you how to create new, reality-based stories that inspire you to action, and take you where you want to go both in your work and personal life. For decades, at the Human Performance Institute, Loehr has been examining the power of story to increase engagement and productivity, and Fortune 500 companies have paid millions to send employees to his program, in which he applies the principles and methods that he now offers in this book. Global business leaders, world-class athletes, military special forces, and thousands of individuals from every walk of life have sought out and benefited from his life-altering insight and expertise. Our capacity to tell stories is one of our profoundest gifts.

Social media is anything but a new phenomenon. From the papyrus letters that Cicero and other Roman statesmen used to exchange news, to the hand-printed tracts of the Reformation and the pamphlets that spread propaganda during the American and French revolutions, the ways people shared information with their peers in the past are echoed in the present. Standage reminds us how historical social networks have much in common with modern social media. The Catholic Church's dilemmas in responding to Martin Luther's attacks are similar to those of today's large institutions in responding to criticism on the Internet, for example, and seventeenth-century complaints about the distractions of coffeehouses mirror modern concerns about social media. Invoking figures from Thomas Paine to Vinton Cerf, co-inventor of the Internet, Standage explores themes that have long been debated, from the tension between freedom of expression and censorship to social media's role in spurring innovation and fomenting revolution. Writing on the Wall draws on history to cast provocative new light on today's social media and encourages debate and discussion about how we'll communicate in the future.\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781620402849'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '162040284X'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 288, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['History'], 'averageRating': 3.5, 'ratingsCount': 2, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aAWqvWLmR4kC&source=gbs_api'}\n",

The real problem is the government’s well-meaning but misguided attempt to reduce the payoffs for success. Four years ago, Edward Conard wrote a controversial bestseller, Unintended Consequences, which set the record straight on the financial crisis of 2008 and explained why U.S. growth was accelerating relative to other high-wage economies. He warned that loose monetary policy would produce neither growth nor inflation, that expansionary fiscal policy would have no lasting benefit on growth in the aftermath of the crisis, and that ill-advised attempts to rein in banking based on misplaced blame would slow an already weak recovery. Unfortunately, he was right. Now he’s back with another provocative argument: that our current obsession with income inequality is misguided and will only slow growth further. Using fact-based logic, Conard tracks the implications of an economy now constrained by both its capacity for risk-taking and by a shortage of properly trained talent—rather than by labor or capital, as was the case historically. He uses this fresh perspective to challenge the conclusions of liberal economists like Larry Summers and Joseph Stiglitz and the myths of “crony capitalism” more broadly. Instead, he argues that the growing wealth of most successful Americans is not to blame for the stagnating incomes of the middle and working classes. If anything, the success of the 1 percent has put upward pressure on employment and wages. Conard argues that high payoffs for success motivate talent to get the training and take the risks that gradually loosen the constraints to growth. Well-meaning attempts to decrease inequality through redistribution dull these incentives, gradually hurting not just the 1 percent but everyone else as well. Conard outlines a plan for growing middle- and working-class wages in an economy with a near infinite supply of labor that is shifting from capital-intensive manufacturing to knowledge-intensive, innovation-driven fields. He urges us to stop blaming the success of the 1 percent for slow wage growth and embrace the upside of inequality: faster growth and greater prosperity for everyone.\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780698409910'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0698409914'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 320, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Business & Economics'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Xr-2CgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

The only person who can create a life you’ll love is you. Our grandmothers fought for the right to work. Our mothers fought for the choice to be in an office or to stay at home. Our generation is the first to fully embrace and celebrate the fact that our lives are multidimensional. Thanks to the women who came before us and paved the way, we can create the lives we want to lead—which look different for each of us. I’ve been fortunate to be able to build my career around my passions, from real estate to fashion. But my professional titles only begin to describe who I am and what I value. I have been an executive and an entrepreneur, but also—and just as importantly—a wife, mother, daughter, and friend. To me, “work” encompasses my efforts to succeed in all of these areas. After appearing on The Apprentice years ago and receiving a flood of letters from young women asking for guidance, I realized the need for more female leaders to speak out publicly in order to change the way society thinks and talks about “women who work.” So I created a forum to do just that. This book evolves the conversation that started on IvankaTrump.com, where so many incredible women (and men!) have shared their experiences, advice, ambitions, and passions. Women who work lead meetings and train for marathons. We learn how to cook and how to code. We inspire our employees and our children. We innovate at our current jobs and start new businesses. Women Who Work will equip you with the best skills I’ve learned from some of the amazing people I’ve met, on subjects such as identifying opportunities, shifting careers smoothly, negotiating, leading teams, starting companies, managing work and family, and helping change the system to make it better for women—now and in the future.

A deed that miraculously sends him head-to-head with Catherine who wants a bigger piece of his hide than his enemies do. But with his dangerous brother hot on his tail to end him, he has to protect Catherine at all costs.

For nearly five centuries the methods and practices of book publishing remained largely unchanged, but at the dawn of the twenty-first century the industry finds itself faced with perhaps the greatest challenges since Gutenberg. A combination of economic pressures and technological change is forcing publishers to alter their practices and think hard about the future of the books in the digital age. In this book - the first major study of trade publishing for more than 30 years - Thompson situates the current challenges facing the industry in an historical context, analysing the transformation of trade publishing in the United States and Britain since the 1960s. He gives a detailed account of how the world of trade publishing really works, dissecting the roles of publishers, agents and booksellers and showing how their practices are shaped by a field that has a distinctive structure and dynamic.

Tanzi Deepak Chopra joins forces with leading physicist Menas Kafatos to explore some of the most important and baffling questions about our place in the world. What happens when modern science reaches a crucial turning point that challenges everything we know about reality? In this brilliant, timely, and practical work, Chopra and Kafatos tell us that we\\'ve reached just such a point. In the coming era, the universe will be completely redefined as a \"human universe\" radically unlike the cold, empty void where human life is barely a speck in the cosmos. You Are the Universe literally means what it says--each of us is a co-creator of reality extending to the vastest reaches of time and space. This seemingly impossible proposition follows from the current state of science, where outside the public eye, some key mysteries cannot be solved, even though they are the very issues that define reality itself: What Came Before the Big Bang? Why Does the Universe Fit Together So Perfectly? Where Did Time Come From? What Is the Universe Made Of? Is the Quantum World Linked to Everyday Life? Do We Live in a Conscious Universe? How Did Life First Begin? “The shift into a new paradigm is happening,” the authors write. “The answers offered in this book are not our invention or eccentric flights of fancy. All of us live in a participatory universe. Once you decide that you want to participate fully with mind, body, and soul, the paradigm shift becomes personal. The reality you inhabit will be yours either to embrace or to change.” What these two great minds offer is a bold, new understanding of who we are and how we can transform the world for the better while reaching our greatest potential.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780307951854'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0307951855'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 288, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Science'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KjYhDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Albom's first nonfiction book since Tuesdays with Morrie, Have a Little Faith begins with an unusual request: an eighty-two-year-old rabbi from Albom's old hometown asks him to deliver his eulogy. Feeling unworthy, Albom insists on understanding the man better, which throws him back into a world of faith he'd left years ago. Meanwhile, closer to his current home, Albom becomes involved with a Detroit pastor--a reformed drug dealer and convict--who preaches to the poor and homeless in a decaying church with a hole in its roof. Moving between their worlds, Christian and Jewish, African-American and white, impoverished and well-to-do, Albom observes how these very different men employ faith similarly in fighting for survival: the older, suburban rabbi embracing it as death approaches; the younger, inner-city pastor relying on it to keep himself and his church afloat. As America struggles with hard times and people turn more to their beliefs, Albom and the two men of God explore issues that perplex modern man: how to endure when difficult things happen; what heaven is; intermarriage; forgiveness; doubting God; and the importance of faith in trying times. Although the texts, prayers, and histories are different, Albom begins to recognize a striking unity between the two worlds--and indeed, between beliefs everywhere. In the end, as the rabbi nears death and a harsh winter threatens the pastor's wobbly church, Albom sadly fulfills the rabbi's last request and writes the eulogy. And he finally understands what both men had been teaching all along: the profound comfort of believing in something bigger than yourself. Have a Little Faith is a book about a life's purpose; about losing belief and finding it again; about the divine spark inside us all. It is one man's journey, but it is everyone's story. Ten percent of the profits from this book will go to charity, including The Hole In The Roof Foundation, which helps refurbish places of worship that aid the homeless.\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781401304089'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1401304087'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 267, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Religion'], 'averageRating': 4.0, 'ratingsCount': 115, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4eqYAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Dyson takes that once in a lifetime conversation between black excellence and pain and the white heroic narrative, and drives it right into the heart of our current politics and culture, leaving the reader reeling and reckoning.\" Robin D. G. Kelley: “Dyson masterfully refracts our present racial conflagration... he reminds us that Black artists and intellectuals bear an awesome responsibility to speak truth to power.\" President Barack Obama: \"Everybody who speaks after Michael Eric Dyson pales in comparison.” In 2015 BLM activist Julius Jones confronted Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton with an urgent query: “What in your heart has changed that’s going to change the direction of this country?” “I don’t believe you just change hearts,” she protested. “I believe you change laws.” The fraught conflict between conscience and politics – between morality and power – in addressing race hardly began with Clinton. An electrifying and traumatic encounter in the sixties crystallized these furious disputes. In 1963 Attorney General Robert Kennedy sought out James Baldwin to explain the rage that threatened to engulf black America. Baldwin brought along some friends, including playwright Lorraine Hansberry, psychologist Kenneth Clark, and a valiant activist, Jerome Smith. It was Smith’s relentless, unfiltered fury that set Kennedy on his heels, reducing him to sullen silence. Kennedy walked away from the nearly three-hour meeting angry – that the black folk assembled didn’t understand politics, and that they weren’t as easy to talk to as Martin Luther King. But especially that they were more interested in witness than policy. But Kennedy’s anger quickly gave way to empathy, especially for Smith. “I guess if I were in his shoes...I might feel differently about this country.” Kennedy set about changing policy – the meeting having transformed his thinking in fundamental ways. There was more: every big argument about race that persists to this day got a hearing in that room. Smith declaring that he’d never fight for his country given its racist tendencies, and Kennedy being appalled at such lack of patriotism, tracks the disdain for black dissent in our own time. His belief that black folk were ungrateful for the Kennedys’ efforts to make things better shows up in our day as the charge that black folk wallow in the politics of ingratitude and victimhood. The contributions of black queer folk to racial progress still cause a stir. BLM has been accused of harboring a covert queer agenda. The immigrant experience, like that of Kennedy – versus the racial experience of Baldwin – is a cudgel to excoriate black folk for lacking hustle and ingenuity. The questioning of whether folk who are interracially partnered can authentically communicate black interests persists. And we grapple still with the responsibility of black intellectuals and artists to bring about social change. What Truth Sounds Like exists at the tense intersection of the conflict between politics and prophecy – of whether we embrace political resolution or moral redemption to fix our fractured racial landscape. The future of race and democracy hang in the balance.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781250199423'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1250199425'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 288, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['History'], 'averageRating': 4.0, 'ratingsCount': 1, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZOw7DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Now the Rogue Warrior writes a whole new set of rules for the shadowy world of Black Ops as he embarks on his most explosive adventure yet -- a volatile tale of double-dealing and international intrigue that blows the lid off today\\'s geopolitical scene. ROUGE WARRIOR®: ECHO PLATOON Dangerous times require dangerous men. And there isn\\'t a man alive more deadly than the Rogue Warrior. Called once more to his country\\'s service, Captain Richard \"NMN\" Marcinko must undertake a critical mission: uncover the hidden motives and players behind the recent attempts at the destabilization of Azerbaijan, the tiny former Soviet republic that holds the key to the oil-rich Caspian Sea. An overland pipeline to the West has been planned, and both Russia and Iran want to control the flow. But others have their own interests in the region, including bilious billionaire Steve Sarkesian, one of the world\\'s richest and most influential men. The Rogue knows the man is involved, but just how he ties in with the Russkies and Arabs isn\\'t clear. And just who else stands to benefit from toppling the Azerbaijani government? The answer is out there somewhere, and Marcinko is going to find it. Pulling together a platoon of his best SEALs, the Rogue Warrior races to the heart of the Middle East, revealing festering layers of treachery and greed that threaten to choke off the black gold that is America\\'s lifeblood. Confronted by well-trained terrorists and false-faced bureaucrats, the Rogue does what he does best -- breaking rules and cracking heads -- until the only thing left standing is justice.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781439140956'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1439140952'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 432, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Fiction'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FMpV2qTkB0IC&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Yanis Varoufakis has appeared before heads of nations, assemblies of experts, and countless students around the world. Now, he faces his most important—and difficult—audience yet. Using clear language and vivid examples, Varoufakis offers a series of letters to his young daughter about the economy: how it operates, where it came from, how it benefits some while impoverishing others. Taking bankers and politicians to task, he explains the historical origins of inequality among and within nations, questions the pervasive notion that everything has its price, and shows why economic instability is a chronic risk. Finally, he discusses the inability of market-driven policies to address the rapidly declining health of the planet his daughter’s generation stands to inherit. Throughout, Varoufakis wears his expertise lightly.

Now, the commando\\'s (redo \"kill-or-be-killed\" is pushed to the brink in a shattering new conflict -- with the fate of America at stake.

Social media is anything but a new phenomenon. From the papyrus letters that Cicero and other Roman statesmen used to exchange news, to the hand-printed tracts of the Reformation and the pamphlets that spread propaganda during the American and French revolutions, the ways people shared information with their peers in the past are echoed in the present. Standage reminds us how historical social networks have much in common with modern social media. The Catholic Church's dilemmas in responding to Martin Luther's attacks are similar to those of today's large institutions in responding to criticism on the Internet, for example, and seventeenth-century complaints about the distractions of coffeehouses mirror modern concerns about social media. Invoking figures from Thomas Paine to Vinton Cerf, co-inventor of the Internet, Standage explores themes that have long been debated, from the tension between freedom of expression and censorship to social media's role in spurring innovation and fomenting revolution. Writing on the Wall draws on history to cast provocative new light on today's social media and encourages debate and discussion about how we'll communicate in the future.\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781620402849'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '162040284X'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 288, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['History'], 'averageRating': 3.5, 'ratingsCount': 2, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aAWqvWLmR4kC&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Those who were born into faith, have lost faith, or are still searching will all be engaged and challenged by this powerful story of \"finding faith\" in relationships with others and with something greater than ourselves. Never satisfied with easy answers or soft platitudes, Mitch explores some of life\\'s greatest mysteries and unanswered questions with great honesty, depth and self reflection. \" --Jim Wallis, CEO and Founder of Sojourners and author of The Great Awakening What if our beliefs were not what divided us, but what pulled us together In Have a Little Faith, Mitch Albom offers a beautifully written story of a remarkable eight-year journey between two worlds--two men, two faiths, two communities--that will inspire readers everywhere. Albom\\'s first nonfiction book since Tuesdays with Morrie, Have a Little Faith begins with an unusual request: an eighty-two-year-old rabbi from Albom\\'s old hometown asks him to deliver his eulogy. Feeling unworthy, Albom insists on understanding the man better, which throws him back into a world of faith he\\'d left years ago. Meanwhile, closer to his current home, Albom becomes involved with a Detroit pastor--a reformed drug dealer and convict--who preaches to the poor and homeless in a decaying church with a hole in its roof. Moving between their worlds, Christian and Jewish, African-American and white, impoverished and well-to-do, Albom observes how these very different men employ faith similarly in fighting for survival: the older, suburban rabbi embracing it as death approaches; the younger, inner-city pastor relying on it to keep himself and his church afloat. As America struggles with hard times and people turn more to their beliefs, Albom and the two men of God explore issues that perplex modern man: how to endure when difficult things happen; what heaven is; intermarriage; forgiveness; doubting God; and the importance of faith in trying times. Although the texts, prayers, and histories are different, Albom begins to recognize a striking unity between the two worlds--and indeed, between beliefs everywhere. In the end, as the rabbi nears death and a harsh winter threatens the pastor\\'s wobbly church, Albom sadly fulfills the rabbi\\'s last request and writes the eulogy. And he finally understands what both men had been teaching all along: the profound comfort of believing in something bigger than yourself. Have a Little Faith is a book about a life\\'s purpose; about losing belief and finding it again; about the divine spark inside us all. It is one man\\'s journey, but it is everyone\\'s story.

'Brilliantly researched, expertly assembled and well written, Going for Broke is a masterful critique of all that's wrong with Australia's judicial system' -- Sydney Morning Herald Everyone has a Bond story. This is the one you haven't heard ... Once upon a time Alan Bond was a hero - the man who won the America's Cup for Australia, the poor immigrant turned sign writer who became a billionaire, the Aussie battler made good. Then came a controversial expose by investigative journalist Paul Barry on ABC's 'Four Corners'. This explosive portrait led to Barry's bestselling The Rise and Fall of Alan Bond and soon afterwards the house of cards collapsed, Bond was made bankrupt and sent to jail. Now Bond is back, after spending less than three and a half years of his sentence for defrauding Bell resources of more than $1200 million - roughly one day in prison for every one million dollars shareholders lost. In Going for Broke, Paul Barry does what no one else has been able to do: show how Bond stashed his fortune overseas, and prove that if your pockets are deep enough and your lawyers good enough, you can get away with almost anything - as long as you go for broke. Going for Broke reads like a thriller, full of cloaks and daggers, car chases, courtroom dramas, larger than life villains and heroes - and it's all true. This is a story that had to be told.

One scandalous proposition. Endless possibilities... *** I can\\'t believe how different things are now; how complicated my life has become in such a short amount of time. It was never supposed to be like this. He\\'s off limits. He\\'s always been off limits. I keep telling myself that; that being here with him is not supposed to feel this good. God, he\\'s not supposed to feel this good. I wonder what my life would have been like now if I had gone to the clinic on a different day, or if I had just insisted on going with the physician I was initially referred to. Never in my life would I have thought that in the events that followed the beginning of a regular school week, a random checkup would end up spawning a highly angst-filled, incredibly confusing, and quickly-unfolding mess. *** Feast your eyeballs and fall absolutely head over heels in love with Eme Strife\\'s edgy, sizzling, intriguing, incredibly sexy, and captivating unconventional romance story. Each installment will keep you strapped to the very edge of your seat and constantly guessing on one hell of an emotional roller-coaster.

After he and his fellows were enchanted for centuries, then finally set free in a future long after their own time, Alexander feared he would never return to his love. Against all odds, the darkfire crystal makes his dream come true, flinging him across the centuries to the world he left behind. Is this his chance to regain the life he lost? Has Katina waited for him? Or has the darkfire crystal sent him back in time for some mysterious purpose of its own? *** The Dragonfire Series of Paranormal Romances Each Dragonfire Novel is a complete romance, but you would probably prefer to read them in order to follow the story of the Dragon's Tail Wars, the final battle for supremacy between the Pyr and the evil Slayers.

Let’s face it: Greg Heffley will never change his wimpy ways. Somebody just needs to explain that to Greg’s father. You see, Frank Heffley actually thinks he can get his son to toughen up, and he enlists Greg in organized sports and other \\x93manly” endeavors. Of course, Greg is able to easily sidestep his father’s efforts to change him. But when Greg’s dad threatens to send him to military academy, Greg realizes he has to shape up . . . or get shipped out. Greg and his family and friends, who make the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books a must-read for middle school readers, are back and at their best in this hilarious new installment of the series, which is sure to please current fans while attracting new ones. Publishers Weekly-1/19/2009: The third book in this genre-busting series is certain to enlarge Kinney’s presence on the bestseller lists, where the previous titles have taken up residence for the past two years. Kinney’s spot-on humor and winning formula of deadpan text set against cartoons are back in full force. This time, Greg starts off on New Year’s Day (he resolves to \\x93help other people improve,” telling his mother, \\x93I think you should work on chewing your potato chips more quietly”) and ends with summer vacation. As he fends off his father’s attempts to make him more of a man (the threat of military school looms), Greg’s hapless adventures include handing out anonymous valentines expressing his true feelings (\\x93Dear James, You smell”), attempting to impress his classmate Holly and single-handedly wrecking his soccer team’s perfect season. Kinney allows himself some insider humor as well, with Greg noting the \\x93racket” children’s book authors have going. \\x93All you have to do is make up a character with a snappy name, and then make sure the character learns a lesson at the end of the book.” Greg, self-centered as ever, may be the exception proving that rule.

(The writing program there produced such acclaimed authors as Cheryl Strayed, Keith Gessen, and Koren Zailckas.) In The Art of Memoir, she synthesizes her expertise as professor and therapy patient, writer and spiritual seeker, recovered alcoholic and “black belt sinner,” providing a unique window into the mechanics and art of the form that is as irreverent, insightful, and entertaining as her own work in the genre. Anchored by excerpts from her favorite memoirs and anecdotes from fellow writers’ experience, The Art of Memoir lays bare Karr’s own process. (Plus all those inside stories about how she dealt with family and friends get told— and the dark spaces in her own skull probed in depth.) As she breaks down the key elements of great literary memoir, she breaks open our concepts of memory and identity, and illuminates the cathartic power of reflecting on the past; anybody with an inner life or complicated history, whether writer or reader, will relate. Joining such classics as Stephen King’s On Writing and Anne Lamott’s Bird by Bird, The Art of Memoir is an elegant and accessible exploration of one of today’s most popular literary forms—a tour de force from an accomplished master pulling back the curtain on her craft.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0062223070'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780062223074'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 256, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Literary Criticism'], 'averageRating': 4.0, 'ratingsCount': 5, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=dSDVjgEACAAJ&dq=current+bestseller+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

This question must be answered in the stillness of outer space and the corridors of the White House. The United States has just unleashed the most powerful weapon in history—a missile-launching satellite called Thor's Hammer that can strike anywhere on the planet in seconds. Now the United States stands unchecked in military dominance. Or does it? The world's other major superpowers, Russia and China, are rocked by America's development, and they scramble to respond by gaining control of the seas. When terrorists hijack Pakistani missiles and fire them at Indian cities, U.S. president Joseph Gardner has only one option: to use the untested Thor's Hammer. But something goes awry and the Hammer misses one of its targets, killing thousands of Pakistani civilians. In retaliation, Pakistan and the Middle East decide to give China strategic naval advantage by granting it access to Middle Eastern ports. To make matters worse, days after the crisis, Somali pirates board a Chinese freighter off the coast of Mogadishu and slaughter the crew. China responds by brutally attacking and then occupying Somalia, quickly setting up missile pads that can target U.S. naval ships across vital sea-lanes in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden, as well as any ships transiting the Suez Canal. Now the U.S. high command is on red alert and the country's security is in total jeopardy. . . . Another flash point quickly emerges—in Earth's orbit. When Chinese and Russian spacecraft surround an American space station, the threat is clear: negotiate and compromise, or China and Russia will cripple the U.S. Navy with ballistic missiles. Retired Air Force lieutenant general Patrick McLanahan returns to assist the commander of the U.S. Space Defense Force, Kai Raydon. But can McLanahan and Raydon stop the Chinese and Russian spaceships? Or will the world's superpowers be plunged into a full-scale war? All the while, President Gardner must face threats from within when his own vice president begins to challenge his decisions—and maybe even his job. With Executive Intent, the New York Times bestselling master thriller-writer Dale Brown crafts an action-packed tale of intrigue and technological weaponry that pits the world's superpowers in a contest for Earth's oceans and ultimate high ground—space.\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780061979255'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0061979252'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 576, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Fiction'], 'averageRating': 3.0, 'ratingsCount': 4, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=zyC9AzYTCNQC&dq=current+bestseller+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Libertarians who want to impeach President Donald J. Trump are not true to their democratic ideals. American political discourse has become uncivilized and the special counsel office has overreaching powers. Legal scholar Alan Dershowitz explains these controversial ideas in his latest book that he hopes will reorient the current national discussion on Trump's possible impeachment. The Case Against Impeaching Trump is a New York Times bestseller. It is written by Dershowitz whose other bestselling books include Chutzpah, The Best Defense, and Reversal of Fortune which was adapted into an award-winning movie. The author is known for defending controversial personalities like Anatoly Sharansky, O.J Simpson, Michael Milken, Mike Tyson, and Claus von Bulow A Brief Look Inside: EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER than the surface of its pages.

The response was overwhelming, and it changed Jane's life. She told all in A Round-Heeled Woman, which Lynne Truss called 'the best book about sex I have read', and which shocked some, amused many and became a bestseller. Five years later, Jane has, like it or not, become a kind of icon for the post-menopause generation. She's a friend and confessor to women of all ages with poignant, tragic or enchanting stories - unaccompanied women, alone for now but searching for sex and romance. And despite her success, Jane herself is still looking for a man to keep her company - not a husband, not even a partner, but the perfect lover, described by Katharine Hepburn as one who 'lives nearby and visits often'. So the story continues, looking around at her generation, back to her youth, and forward to... whatever grabs her fancy. And like many unaccompanied women, Jane's also in search of a better place to live. Her current tiny apartment doesn't allow for much in the way of romance, let alone the giant toy box she wants to fill for her granddaughter, born on her birthday and now just two, who's brought another kind of love to her life. But as a sporadic earner on a teacher's pension, she can never afford the dream house. So the search continues, for love, friendship, sex, a roof over her head - it's what keeps this seventy-two year old author young, and will keep readers wonderfully entertained in this funny, deft and touching memoir.\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781407021409'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1407021400'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 272, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Biography & Autobiography'], 'averageRating': 3.0, 'ratingsCount': 1, 'maturityRating': 'MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=VjR_VepffrcC&dq=current+bestseller+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

A funny and caustic look at the emotional and psychological battles of a 1970s unfulfilled wife and mother, Loose Ends is a powerful precursor to author Barbara Raskin’s bestselling feminist novel, Hot Flashes.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781504038386'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '150403838X'}], 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': True}, 'pageCount': 313, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Fiction'], 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HI5EDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Twenty-five years later, the Kill Club—a secret society obsessed with notorious crimes—locates Libby and pumps her for details. They hope to discover proof that may free Ben. Libby hopes to turn a profit off her tragic history: She’ll reconnect with the players from that night and report her findings to the club—for a fee. As Libby’s search takes her from shabby Missouri strip clubs to abandoned Oklahoma tourist towns, the unimaginable truth emerges, and Libby finds herself right back where she started—on the run from a killer. Editorial ReviewsFrom Publishers WeeklyStarred Review. Edgar-finalist Flynn\\'s second crime thriller tops her impressive debut, Sharp Objects. When Libby Day\\'s mother and two older sisters were slaughtered in the family\\'s Kansas farmhouse, it was seven-year-old Libby\\'s testimony that sent her 15-year-old brother, Ben, to prison for life. Desperate for cash 24 years later, Libby reluctantly agrees to meet members of the Kill Club, true crime enthusiasts who bicker over famous cases. She\\'s shocked to learn most of them believe Ben is innocent and the real killer is still on the loose. Though initially interested only in making a quick buck hocking family memorabilia, Libby is soon drawn into the club\\'s pseudo-investigation, and begins to question what exactly she saw—or didn\\'t see—the night of the tragedy. Flynn fluidly moves between cynical present-day Libby and the hours leading up to the murders through the eyes of her family members. When the truth emerges, it\\'s so twisted that even the most astute readers won\\'t have predicted it. (May) Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.From The New YorkerLibby Day, the protagonist of Flynn’s disturbing second novel, was, as a seven-year-old, the only survivor of her family’s brutal murder by her older brother, an event dubbed by the media the “Satan Sacrifice of Kinnakee, Kansas.” Twenty-five years later, she has become a hardened, selfish young woman with no friends or family. Since the tragedy, her life has been paid for by donations of well-wishers, but, with that fund now empty, Libby must find a way to make money. Her search leads her to The Kill Club, a secret society of people obsessed with the details of notorious murders. As Libby tries to gather artifacts to sell to The Kill Club (whose members, it turns out, doubt the guilt of her brother), she is forced to reëxamine the events of the night of the murder. Flynn’s well-paced story deftly shows the fallibility of memory and the lies a child tells herself to get through a trauma. Copyright ©2008 Click here to subscribe to The New Yorker --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.From Bookmarks MagazineCritics agreed that with the publication of Dark Places, Flynn’s success with Sharp Objects was no fluke. Here she crafts a compelling protagonist—a troubled, self-proclaimed liar who embarks on a painful journey of self-discovery and redemption. Many reviewers praised Flynn’s sophisticated narration: the novel alternates between Libby’s adult voice and those of her brother and mother on the day of the murders. If a few too many female villains and some clumsy plotting mar the flow, never mind; most readers will enjoy this “soul quest, the tale of a woman’s coming to terms with herself and with the consequences of her selfish, childish, fearful choices”—and will look forward to Flynn’s next offering (Chicago Sun-Times). Copyright 2009 Bookmarks Publishing LLC --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.From Booklist*Starred Review* Libby Day’s mother and two younger sisters were viciously slaughtered when she was seven, and her brother, Ben, against whom she testified, has been incarcerated ever since. Twenty-five years later, Libby is still suffering from the aftereffects of the notorious murders. Although it sometimes takes her days to work up the psychic energy to wash her hair, she is not quite the timorous victim the press makes her out to be. When she finds out that the trust fund set up in her name is about to run out of money (the do-gooders have long since moved on to fresh tragedies), she starts gouging money from members of the Kill Club, a group of true-crime fans obsessed with the Day murders. Greedily pricing family memorabilia, wondering how much the Kill Club creeps will pony up for an old birthday card, she learns that none of them believes her brother committed the crime. As she starts investigating, the narrative returns to the day of the murders, intercutting Libby’s current-day hunt with the actual events of the day. Despite the fact that the ending is known from the get-go, Flynn (Sharp Objects, 2006) injects these chapters with unbearable tension. And unlovable Libby, mean-spirited and greedy, shows her true colors and her deep courage. A gritty, riveting thriller with a one-of-a-kind, tart-tongued heroine. --Joanne Wilkinson --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.ReviewNEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER Named one of the Best Books of 2009 by Publishers Weekly A Weekend TODAY “Top Summer Read” The New Yorker\\'s Reviewers\\' Favorite from 2009 A 2009 Favorite Fiction Pick by The Chicago Tribune “[A] nerve-fraying thriller.” —The New York Times “Flynn’s well-paced story deftly shows the fallibility of memory and the lies a child tells herself to get through a trauma.” —The New Yorker “Gillian Flynn coolly demolished the notion that little girls are made of sugar and spice in Sharp Objects, her sensuous and chilling first thriller. In DARK PLACES, her equally sensuous and chilling follow-up, Flynn…has conjured up a whole new crew of feral and troubled young females….[A] propulsive and twisty mystery.” —Entertainment Weekly “Flynn follows her deliciously creepy Sharp Objects with another dark tale . . . The story, alternating between the 1985 murders and the present, has a tense momentum that works beautifully. And when the truth emerges, it’s so macabre not even twisted little Libby Day could see it coming.” —People (4 stars) “Crackles with peevish energy and corrosive wit.” —Dallas Morning News “A riveting tale of true horror by a writer who has all the gifts to pull it off.” —Chicago Tribune \"In her first psychological thriller, Sharp Objects, Flynn created a world unsparingly grim and nasty (the heroine carves words into her own flesh) written with irresistibly mordant humor. The sleuth in her equally disturbing and original second novel is Libby Day....It\\'s Flynn\\'s gift that she can make a caustic, self-loathing, unpleasant protagonist someone you come to root for.” —New York Magazine “[A] gripping thriller.” —Cosmopolitan \"Gillian Flynn is the real deal, a sharp, acerbic, and compelling storyteller with a knack for the macabre.” –Stephen King “Another winner!” —Harlan Coben “Gillian Flynn’s writing is compulsively good. I would rather read her than just about any other crime writer.” —Kate Atkinson “Dark Places grips you from the first page and doesn\\'t let go.” —Karin Slaughter “With her blistering debut Sharp Objects, Gillian Flynn hit the ground running. Dark Places demonstrates that was no fluke.” —Val McDermid “Dark Places\\' Libby Day may seem unpleasant company at first–she\\'s humoring those with morbid curiosities about her family\\'s murders in order to get money out of them–but her steely nature and sharp tongue are compelling. \\'I have a meanness inside me,\\'she says, \\'real as an organ.\\'Yes she does, and by the end of this pitch-black novel, after we\\'ve loosened our grip on its cover and started breathing deeply again, we\\'re glad Flynn decided to share it.” —Jessa Crispin, NPR.org “Flynn returns to the front ranks of emerging thriller writers with her aptly titled new novel . . . Those who prefer their literary bones with a little bloody meat will be riveted.” —Portland Oregonian “Gillian Flynn may turn out to be a more gothic John Irving for the 21st century, a writer who uses both a surgeon\\'s scalpel and a set of rusty harrow discs to rip the pretty face off middle America.” —San Jose Mercury News “The world of this novel is all underside, all hard flinch, and Flynn’s razor-sharp prose intensifies this effect as she knuckles in on every sentence. . . . The slick plotting in DARK PLACES will gratify the lover of a good thriller–but so, too, will Flynn’s prose, which is ferocious and unrelenting and pure pleasure from word one.” —Cleveland Plain Dealer “Gillian Flynn’s second novel, DARK PLACES, proves that her first – Sharp Objects – was no fluke. . . . tough, surprising crime fiction that dips its toes in the deeper waters of literary fiction.” —Chicago Sun-Times \"Flynn fully inhabits Libby—a damaged woman whose world has resided entirely in her own head for the majority of her life and who is prone to dark metaphors: \\'Draw a picture of my soul, and it’d be a scribble with fangs.\\' Half the fun of DARK PLACES is Libby’s swampy psychology, which Flynn leads us through without the benefit of hip waders.” —Time Out Chicago “Clever, engrossing and disturbing….[DARK PLACES] should cement [Flynn’s] place in the great authors of crime fiction.” —Crimespree “[D]eliciously creepy...Flynn follows 250-some pages of masterful plotting and character development with a speedway pileup of pulse-pounding revelations.” —Chicago Reader “A genuinely shocking denouement.” —Romantic Times “Sardonic, riveting . . . Like Kate Atkinson, Flynn has figured out how to fuse the believable characters, silken prose and complex moral vision of literary fiction to the structure of a crime story. . . . You can sense trouble coming like a storm moving over the prairie, but can\\'t quite detect its shape.” —Laura Miller, Salon.com “These characters are fully realized—so true they could step off the page….hints of what truly happened to the Day family feel painfully, teasingly paced as they forge an irresistible trail to the truth….Could. Not. Stop. Reading.” —Bookreporter.com “Libby’s voice is a pitch-perfect blend of surliness and emotionally charged imagery. . . . The Kansas in these pages is a bleak, deterministic place where bad blood and lies generate horrifically unintended consequences. Though there’s little redemption here, Flynn manages to unearth the humanity buried beneath the squalor.” —Bloomberg.com “Set in the bleak Midwest of America, this evocation of small-town life and dysfunctional people is every bit as horribly fascinating as Capote’s journalistic retelling of a real family massacre, In Cold Blood, which it eerily resembles. This is only Flynn’ s second crime novel–her debut was the award-winning Sharp Objects–and demonstrates even more forcibly her precocious writing ability and talent for the macabre.” —Daily Mail (UK) “Flynn’s second novel is a wonderful evocation of drab small-town life. The time-split narrative works superbly and the atmosphere is eerily macabre—Dark Places is even better than the author’s award-winning Sharp Objects.” —The Guardian (UK) “A gritty, riveting thriller with a one-of-a-kind, tart-tongued heroine.” —Booklist, starred review “Flynn’s second crime thriller tops her impressive debut, Sharp Objects…When the truth emerges, it’s so twisted that even the most astute readers won’t have predicted it.” —Publishers Weekly, starred review “The sole survivor of a family massacre is pushed into revisiting a past she’d much rather leave alone, in Flynn’s scorching follow-up to Sharp Objects . . . Flynn intercuts Libby’s venomous detective work with flashbacks to the fatal day 24 years ago so expertly that as they both hurtle toward unspeakable revelations, you won’t know which one you’re more impatient to finish. . . . every sentence crackles with enough baleful energy to fuel a whole town through the coldest Kansas winter.” —Kirkus Reviews “Once in a while a book comes along that puts a new spin on an old idea. More than 40 years ago, Truman Capote took readers inside the Clutter farmhouse in Holcomb, KS, to show them what it was like to walk in a killer\\'s shoes. Flynn takes modern readers back to Kansas to explore the fictional 1985 Day family massacre from the perspective of a survivor as well as the suspects. . . . tight plotting and engaging characters.” —Library Journal', 'industryIdentifiers': None, 'readingModes': {'text': True, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 349, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Fiction'], 'averageRating': 3.5, 'ratingsCount': 3189, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=hxMXBQAAQBAJ&dq=current+bestseller+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Centuries ago, Illarion was betrayed—a dragon made human against his will, then forced to serve humanity as a dragonmount in their army, and to fight for them in barbaric wars, even while he hated everything about them. Enslaved and separated from everyone he knew and from his own dragon brothers, he was forced into exile in a fey realm where he lost the only thing he ever really loved. Now Illarion has a chance to regain what’s been lost—to have the one thing he covets most. But only if he gives up his brothers and forsakes the oaths he holds most dear. Yet what terrifies him most isn’t the cost his happiness might incur, it’s the fact that there is just enough human in his dragon’s heart that he might actually be willing to pay it and betray everything and everyone—to see the entire world burn...', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1250092426'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781250092427'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 352, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Fiction'], 'averageRating': 3.0, 'ratingsCount': 3, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=4RjOjwEACAAJ&dq=current+bestseller+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

One scandalous proposition. Endless possibilities... *** My legs refuse to move. And my arms. And, quite possibly my heart, as well. Hell, even my eyes can’t bring themselves to blink, completely bulged and glassy, as if they’re large marbles sitting in my face. My spine turns to ice, feeling insanely rigid and stiff I think I just might snap right in half if I even breathe too hard. Maybe it’s a good thing my lungs just decided to quit on me, too, then. My brain is having serious trouble processing the words in front of me. My mouth goes incredibly dry, and I can’t even bring myself to swallow to relieve the parched sensation. I just stand there for several seconds—or maybe it’s several minutes, I don’t know—unable to look away from the piece of paper. Reserved for sub. Reserved. For. Sub. R.e.s.e.r.v.e.d. f.o.r. s.u.b. Every single letter in those three unsettling, heart-stopping words loop around in my head over and over again until that’s all I can see. Everything else fades away, and I experience the most chilling, sobering moment of clarity I’ve ever had. This is for real.

One scandalous proposition. Endless possibilities... *** My body jerks upright, lunging itself out of my fetal position as if I’ve just been electrocuted by a dozen angry eels. My eyes dart to the closed drawer, bulging wide open as a blended rush of surprise, anxiety, and perhaps a teeny tiny bit of excitement force my heart to pick up its pace. A hefty dose of adrenaline instantly floods my system, and all traces of tiredness and fatigue instantly disappear. I extend my arm without thinking, my body moving on impulse, but my hand freezes as soon as it comes into contact with the drawer, my fingers going stiff and rigid as soon as they wrap themselves around the small knob. After several more seconds and rapid, shallow breaths, I finally bring myself to pull it open, and when my fingers find the outline of the unmistakable hard, thin plastic device, my heart pumps so fast that I think it just might bruise itself from the exertion. I grab it from under the clutter of papers and random items, almost dropping it in my nervous klutziness. And then I see it, displayed boldly across the sleek touchscreen. A text message. From him. *** Feast your eyeballs and fall absolutely head over heels in love with Eme Strife\\'s edgy, sizzling, intriguing, incredibly sexy, and captivating unconventional romance story. Each installment will keep you strapped to the very edge of your seat and constantly guessing on one hell of an emotional roller-coaster. You\\'ll never think of the phrase, \"Doctor-Patient Confidentiality”, in the same way ever again once you read this! This story unfolds over several volumes. IT IS NOT A STANDALONE. This is the seventh book. Rated 18+ This series contains mature and adult content (nudity, graphic sex, and strong language). Because of its explicit nature, it is intended for mature audiences only. Reader discretion is advised.

Former FBI Special Agent Sloane Burbank survived a life-threatening injury sustained in the line of duty, only to face leaving a job she loves in order to recuperate. As an independent consultant, she now uses her specialized skills to train law enforcement and private organizations in crisis resolution. But when one of her closest childhood friends mysteriously disappears, and the woman's devastated parents beg for her help, Sloane takes the case—even though her ex-lover Derek Parker is the FBI agent in charge. Special Agent Derek Parker, now assigned to the Asian Criminal Enterprise Task Force in the FBI's New York Field Office, has no time to spare for a year-old case he sees as a dead end—especially since it would mean working with a woman he never expected to see again. He's pursuing the leader of a Chinese gang and trying to solve a series of grisly murders in Chinatown, so he initially offers Sloane the case files and minimal cooperation. But as more women disappear and others turn up brutally murdered, Derek's priorities shift, and he and Sloane come to the sickening realization that these random crimes are linked to the same crazed killer. No one can anticipate when he will strike again, but when Sloane becomes the target of the killer's twisted obsession, it's clear that his ultimate fantasy is even more psychotic than either of them ever imagined.\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780061578892'}, {'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0061578894'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 640, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Fiction'], 'averageRating': 4.5, 'ratingsCount': 22, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=OFxls-vjSG4C&dq=current+bestseller+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Taken aback to find that the ageing but still beautiful Countess is having a love affair with a dissolute young rake, Olinda sympathises with her estranged son, the Earl, who despises his mother for her loose morals. Drawn reluctantly into the Kelvedon family’s tangle of bitterness and resentment, Olinda finds herself gently advising the Earl – or as he puts it, inspiring him.

In this lively and compelling account—now updated with new material by the author—Rubin chronicles her adventures during the twelve months she spent test-driving the wisdom of the ages, current scientific research, and lessons from popular culture about how to be happier. Among other things, she found that novelty and challenge are powerful sources of happiness; that money can help buy happiness, when spent wisely; that outer order contributes to inner calm; and that the very smallest of changes can make the biggest difference.

Providing almost instant access to space and every corner of the globe using the Black Stallion spaceplanes, the ABF's powerful network of satellites and unmanned aircraft controlled from space can not only attack any target anywhere on the planet within hours but can even invade any computer network as easily as making a phone call. But the program has its critics and doomsayers, including Russia, the United Nations, and the American press. Wealthy, Western-educated, and sophisticated Russian president Leonid Zevitin uses a combination of top-secret anti-spacecraft weaponry, fearmongering, and new U.S. president Joseph Gardner's own egotism in an effective plan to eliminate all support for the space program. Gardner and his allies in Congress and the Pentagon will stop at nothing—even destroying one of their own—to get what they want. Yet McLanahan and his forces refuse to allow the Russian aggression to stand. McLanahan ignores directives from the White House and Pentagon to stand down and orders the ABF to attack secret Russian bases in Iran. President Gardner orders McLanahan's immediate arrest.

Currently in control of the Aerospace Battle Force from Armstrong Space Station, McLanahan closely watches Russia's movement of weaponry while defending himself against the President's attempts to discredit him. In a race against time, McLanahan must outmaneuver his own countrymen, defeat the Russians, and expose the truth . . . or die trying.\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0061173118'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780061173110'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 384, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Fiction'], 'averageRating': 3.5, 'ratingsCount': 3, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=pp_NIac7fXMC&dq=current+bestseller+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

Sadly this facility is not available with the ebook.\"The Diary of a Disgruntled Man is the first of Vernon Coleman\\'s series of diaries - for the year 2011. Please do NOT buy this book expecting it to be like the Bilbury books etc. (Other diaries include `Just Another Bloody Year\\', \\'Bugger off and Leave Me Alone\\' ,\\'The Return of the Disgruntled Man\\', \\'Life on the Edge\\' and \\'The Game\\'s Afoot\\').This is a book for the politically incorrect who question and laugh at the absurdities of modern life and who have little respect for those who rule our lives without a passing nod in the direction of democracy and justice. The Diary of a Disgruntled Man is wild, original, tough, revealing, laugh out loud funny, heart breakingly sad and always painfully honest. It is unsuitable for the overly sensitive and politically correct.The revealing flashbacks about Vernon\\'s life as a GP, police surgeon, television presenter, best-selling author, newspaper columnist and publisher make it the closest thing Vernon will ever write to an autobiography.But it is more than an autobiography; it is a social commentary in the tradition of Samuel Pepys and in the tradition of Pepys it is gloriously indiscreet and rather rude. `I am not going to edit my life,\\' said Vernon, when asked if he really wanted to leave everything in the book. The humour is sharp, ironic and very, very English.You will discover what (former Private Eye editor) Richard Ingrams threatened to tell (current Private Eye editor) Ian Hislop about Vernon (and Vernon\\'s response) and what happened when Vernon officially applied for a job with MI5. The Diary of a Disgruntled Man is 240,000 words long and we have a large boxful of letters from readers who loved every page.Vernon Coleman is a qualified doctor and GP. He has earned his living as a professional author for over 30 years and his books have appeared in the Sunday Times bestseller lists and in bestseller lists around the world.

From the vantage point of a world on the edge, Wages of Rebellion investigates what social and psychological factors cause revolution, rebellion and resistance. Drawing on an ambitious overview of prominent philosophers, historians and literary figures, Chris Hedges shows not only the harbingers of a coming crisis but also the nascent seeds of rebellion. His message is clear: popular uprisings across the globe are inevitable in the face of environmental destruction and wealth polarization. Focusing on the stories of rebels from around the world and throughout history, Hedges investigates what it takes to be a rebel in modern times. Utilizing the work of Reinhold Niebuhr, he describes the motivation that guides the actions of rebels as \"sublime madness\"--the state of passion that causes the rebel to engage in an unavailing fight against overwhelmingly powerful and oppressive forces. For Hedges, resistance is carried out not for its success, but as a moral imperative that affirms life. Those who rise up against the odds will be those endowed with this \"sublime madness.\" From South African activists who dedicated their lives to ending apartheid, to contemporary anti-fracking protests in Alberta, to whistleblowers in pursuit of transparency, Wages of Rebellion shows the cost of a life committed to speaking the truth and demanding justice.', 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '0345807863'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9780345807861'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 304, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': ['Dissenters'], 'averageRating': 4.0, 'ratingsCount': 4, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=7hWYoAEACAAJ&dq=current+bestseller+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",

The Marquis finds this affaire-de-Coeur amusing and enjoyable until Peony says that that she intends to tell her husband what they have been doing and ask him for a divorce. The Marquis is horrified because he was determined never to get married until he is much older and needs to have an heir. He knows, however, that Peony is serious and he will have to be exceedingly clever not to be involved in a scandal that would force him to live abroad for some years. He is at Royal Ascot and is hoping to win the Gold Cup. He is not successful, but as the race ends he sees the Duke of Hawkhurst, who was a friend of his father's. The Duke has always been in debt and a way suddenly occurs to the Marquis of saving himself from the horror of Peony's intentions. He tells the Duke that he wishes to marry his daughter, Natalie, in two days' time. The Duke thinks it strange, but he realises that a very rich son-in-law will save him when he is on the verge of bankruptcy. However, his daughter Natalie is in love with the charming son of a neighbour, who is far from being a rich man, and she is in despair at the prospect of being married to the Marquis.

George Carlin\\'s hilarious When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops offers his cutting-edge opinions and observational humor on everything from evasive euphemistic language to politicians to the media to dead people. Nothing and no one is safe! Despite the current climate of political correctness, Carlin is not afraid to take on controversial topics: --Carlin on the media: The media comprises equal parts business, politics, advertising, public relations, and show business. Nice combination. Enough bull for Texas to open a chain of branch offices. --Carlin on the battle of the sexes: Here\\'s all you have to know about men and women: women are crazy, men are stupid. And the main reason women are crazy is that men are stupid. --Carlin on hygiene: When did they pass a law that says the people who make my sandwich have to be wearing gloves? I\\'m not comfortable with this. I don\\'t want glove residue all over my food; it\\'s not sanitary. Who knows where these gloves have been? --Carlin on evasive language: Just to demonstrate how far using euphemisms in language has gone, some psychologists are now actually referring to ugly people as those with \"severe appearance deficits.\" Hey, Doctor. How\\'s that for \"denial\" --Carlin on politics: No self-respecting politician would ever admit to working in the government. They prefer to think of themselves \"serving the nation.\" To help visualize the service they provide the country, you may wish to picture the things that take place on a stud farm. The thinking person\\'s comic who uses words as weapons, Carlin puts voice to issues that capture the modern imagination. For instance, why are there Ten Commandments? Are UFOs real? What will the future really be like? This brand-new collection tackles all that and more.

Prince Ivan is often at his house and it was not long before he falls in love with Richard's sister Elizabeth, who is very beautiful.

Let’s face it: Greg Heffley will never change his wimpy ways. Somebody just needs to explain that to Greg’s father. You see, Frank Heffley actually thinks he can get his son to toughen up, and he enlists Greg in organized sports and other “manly” endeavors. Of course, Greg is able to easily sidestep his father’s efforts to change him. But when Greg’s dad threatens to send him to military academy, Greg realizes he has to shape up . . . or get shipped out. Greg and his family and friends, who make the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books a must-read for middle school readers, are back and at their best in this hilarious new installment of the series, which is sure to please current fans while attracting new ones. Publishers Weekly-1/19/2009: The third book in this genre-busting series is certain to enlarge Kinney’s presence on the bestseller lists, where the previous titles have taken up residence for the past two years. Kinney’s spot-on humor and winning formula of deadpan text set against cartoons are back in full force. This time, Greg starts off on New Year’s Day (he resolves to “help other people improve,” telling his mother, “I think you should work on chewing your potato chips more quietly”) and ends with summer vacation. As he fends off his father’s attempts to make him more of a man (the threat of military school looms), Greg’s hapless adventures include handing out anonymous valentines expressing his true feelings (“Dear James, You smell”), attempting to impress his classmate Holly and single-handedly wrecking his soccer team’s perfect season. Kinney allows himself some insider humor as well, with Greg noting the “racket” children’s book authors have going. “All you have to do is make up a character with a snappy name, and then make sure the character learns a lesson at the end of the book.” Greg, self-centered as ever, may be the exception proving that rule.

Encountering the brooding and handsome Prince Gregor Razghadi, Konstantina finds herself enmeshed in a disturbing story of love and betrayal. Between the enchanting moments she comes to spend with the Prince by moonlight and the bewildering life she leads at Megherny Castle with only her Guardian, the unappealing Baron Schenck and the mysterious Madame Zand for company, she is forced to confront the workings of her own heart. Her trust is shattered when Konstantina suspects that Prince Gregor is not, and never will be, free to love. Meanwhile, the Countess Mordhile has her own reasons for keeping her young and vulnerable Ward under her strict control. How the web of conflicting intrigue surrounding Konstantina eventually unravels. How she tries to escape from her Guardian and Megherny Castle as well as her own heart. And how she finds out that her prayers are answered and that love can be hers, despite so much turmoil, is all told in this exciting romantic story by BARBARA CARTLAND\", 'industryIdentifiers': [{'type': 'ISBN_10', 'identifier': '1507542526'}, {'type': 'ISBN_13', 'identifier': '9781507542521'}], 'readingModes': {'text': False, 'image': False}, 'pageCount': 198, 'printType': 'BOOK', 'categories': None, 'averageRating': None, 'ratingsCount': None, 'maturityRating': 'NOT_MATURE', 'language': 'en', 'infoLink': 'http://books.google.com/books?id=ai16rgEACAAJ&dq=current+bestseller+books&hl=&source=gbs_api'}\n",
